ArtSmart students attend class daily at the museum for gallery tours and seminars with the museum's volunteer and professional staff.  They learn about art history, aesthetics, art criticism, and the functions of an art museum.  Students keep daily journals and write essays about works of art, exhibitions, and special programs in the museum.  Ultimately, the students go into city schools to teach other students about art in the museum's collection.<P>For more information on the Art Smart program contact:<BR>Art Smart Coordinator (612) 870-3074</HTML>
