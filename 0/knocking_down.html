Also this month, watch for significant movement of Asian and Greco-Roman objects as well as certain Decorative Arts galleries to prepare the second and third floors for construction. On April 8, the Art Research and Reference Library will close until further notice due to the construction project.<P>Please call the Visitor and Member Center at (612) 870-3131 or email <A HREF="mailto:miagen@artsMIA.org">miagen@artsMIA.org</A> before you visit the museum to find out detailed information about which areas (and works of arts) are affected by construction activity.
