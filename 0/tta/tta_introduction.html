Your students cantake a trip back in time to the tombs of ancient Egypt, explore the culturesof the Americas from ancient times to the present, or discover the art andtraditions of West and Central Africa!  These are just a few of the adventuresavailable by taking advantage of our extensive educational resources.  <BR><BR>This catalog describes museum's resources and customized services thatintroduce students to the diverse world of art.  Our classroom materialsand guided tours are broadly based in the humanities and relevant to everyarea of study-from social studies and language arts to math and science. We hope you'll make our resources and collection integral parts of yourcurriculum.  <BR><BR>Be sure to visit our new gallery spaces, too.  We've reinstalled the collectionin more meaningful ways and placed many works on view for the first time. Of course, as we reinstall other galleries, some works of art may be temporarilyin storage.  We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause. To find out if a particular work or tour will be available when you come,call the Tour Scheduling Office at 870-3140.<BR><BR>We look forward to serving you.<BR><BR>The Education Division<BR>The Minneapolis Institute of Arts<BR><BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><B>To help integrate the visual arts into your curriculum, pleasecall:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>Curriculum materials: Laura Pereira (612) 870-3134<BR>Tours: Sandy Satz or Valerie Kriesel (612) 870-3140<BR>Custom-designed tours: Dieane Levy (612) 870-3205 <BR>or Sheila McGuire (612) 870-3206</BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE><HR><CENTER><A HREF="../index.html#index">Main Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A>~ <A HREF="tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A> ~ <A HREF="tta_tours.html">Teachingthe Arts Tours</A> ~ <A HREF="art_adventure_program.html">Art AdventureProgram</A> ~ <A HREF="classroom_materials.html">Classroom Materials</A>~ <A HREF="tta_materials_for_sale.html">Materials for Sale</A></CENTER><HR></BODY></HTML>
