He believed that only the graphic arts could express the extremes of fantasy and emotion, which were inappropriate to the more realistic arts of painting and sculpture. The 14 print portfolios Klinger created between 1879 and 1915 were instrumental in reviving the art of etching and graphic arts in turn-of-the-century Germany.<BR><BR clear=left><A NAME="scholars"></A> <B>The Scholar's Study: Chinese Art in the Literati Tradition</B><BR><IMG SRC="scholars.gif" WIDTH=62 HEIGHT=125 hspace="2" vspace="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom> <A HREF="restrictions.html">(c)</A> 9k<BR>Continuing<BR>Gale Gallery<BR>This exhibition includes between 50 and 60 works of literati art dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries drawn from the permanent collection.
