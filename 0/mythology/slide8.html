Out of Chaos came Night and Erebus (AIR-a-bus), a dim place.All was still, black, silent, and without end until Love emerged.  Love broughtLight and Day, which then produced Earth.  No one can recall just how any ofthis happened.  Then Earth, called Gaea (JEE-ah), produced the boundless blueHeaven, called Uranus (YUR-a-nus).  The union of Heaven and Earth producedgigantic monstrous children with overwhelming power.  Among their children werethe one-eyed Cyclops (SIGH-clops), the 100-handed Hecatoncheires(hec-a-TAHN-churs), and the mighty natural forces, the Titans.<p>			Six female and six male Titans ruled the universe.  One of them was calledOceanus because he ruled the great river Ocean that encircled the earth andformed its outermost limits.  Oceanus and his Titan wife, Tethys (TEH-thees),had 3,000 sons and 3,000 daughters.  Their sons were the spirits of the rivers.Their daughters, known as Oceanids, were spirits of streams and springs.Eventually, the Titans' children destroyed their parents and became the gods ofthe Greek world.<p></ul><hr><center><a name="Background"></A><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><b>Creation Myth</b><br>Greek creation myths, and their Roman counterparts, explainedthe origin, structure, and nature of the world.  These mythologies were central to ancient religions, though astime passed they came to be viewed as literature more than anything. Hesiod(HES-ee-ud), the Greek poet-historian, wrote the most detailed account of theGreeks' creation mythology.  He presentedcreation in the form of a genealogical chart. According to Hesiod, the sixTitan couples produced the first generation of Greek deities.   <p><p>			The ancient Romans adapted much of the Greeks' mythology, including theirnotion of creation.  In many cases, Roman household gods, practical forces indaily life, took on the fabulous personalities and exciting exploits of theGreek gods.   <p><b>Roman Empire</b><br>The Roman Empire was born in 31 B.C. when Octavian Caesar,later known as Augustus, triumphed after 90 years of civil war. Augustus andhis immediate successors in the 1st century A.D. promoted the arts in order todisplay the grandeur of their empire.    <p><b>Realism</b><br>		The general, idealized figures of ancient Greek sculpture,frequently emulated by early Romans, gave way to realistic portraiture in the1st century A.D.  The Romans, who valued the family, recorded the faces andcharacter traits of important family members in realistic portraits.Individualistic details such as wrinkled foreheads, prominent noses, orslacking jowls were marks of hard work and accomplishment.  Artists portrayedgods and other mythical beings with similar <a href="glossary.html#REALISM">REALISM</a> and individuality.<p><b>Furnishings</b><br>		Affluent Romans liked to display their wealth inelaborately decorated furnishings.  Ornamental pieces, called bosses, adornedthe juncture points of tables, stools, and the curving heads and footboards ofluxurious bronze and wooden couches. The finest pieces incorporated detailed<a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAY</a> work in silver, ivory, and tortoiseshell.<br><br><b>Oceanus</b><br>		This circular bronze boss depicts the Titan Oceanus.His bearded face projects out from a <a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a> of decorative scales.  Inkeeping with the artistic realism of the time, Oceanus is portrayed as abearded old man, not as a monster or a sublime force of nature.  Locks of wavyhair frame his heavy face.  His eyes are inlaid silver, and silver and copperinlays highlight his cheeks, nose, and forehead.  Two dolphins leap from thetop of his head, suggesting the form of a crown and alluding to Oceanus's roleas an aquatic ruler.  Two fish dive among the locks of his hair near histemples, and two others emerge from his beard.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Oceanus.</b>  What did Oceanus rule overas a Titan?  <B>(The ocean.)</B>  Can you see evidence of his role as ruler of theocean in this bronze?  <B>(Head emerges out of a "scaly" <a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a>.  Two dolphinsrise out of his head at the crown.  Fish swim in and out of his hair andbeard.)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	How big do you think this bronze sculpture is?  <b>Discuss the functionof the boss as furniture decoration. </b> With this purpose in mind, how big doyou think this is? <b>Images can be deceiving!  Show an object of similar sizeto illustrate the small size of the boss - 4 1/8 inches. </b>What kind offurniture do you think this was made for? A chair?  A bed?  Why?  <B>(No rightanswer since we don't know for sure.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	<a href="glossary.html#SUBTRACTIVE">SUBTRACTIVE SCULPTURE</a> is made by removing unwanted material from a solidmass, such as wood or marble.  <a href="glossary.html#ADDITIVE">ADDITIVE SCULPTURE</a> is made by building up a formby molding or <a href="glossary.html#MODELING">MODELING</a> a material such as clay.  Is this bronze boss an exampleof additive or subtractive sculpture?  <b> Discuss bronze casting, an additivemethod of sculpting, in which an artist models the sculpture in clay, then usesit to make a mold for molten bronze.</b><p>			<B>4.</B>	Artists throughout time have often <a href="glossary.html#EMBELLISH">EMBELLISHED</a> their sculptures, addingmaterial to the basic medium for decorative and/or expressive effects.  How didthis artist embellish this sculpture?  <B>(<a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> silver eyes and silver andcopper inlay on cheeks, nose, and forehead.)</B> What function do theseembellishments serve?  <B>(Adding precious metals make the boss more valuable,expressing the wealth of its owner.)</B><br><br><hr><b>Think</b><br><B>1.</B>	This bronze boss was used to decorate a piece of furniture inancient Rome.  How do we decorate furniture today?  <B>(Carved wood, paint,combining different materials such as wood and metal, much like ancientRomans!)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	Ancient Romans placed great emphasis on realistic portraiture and sochose to represent the natural force of the ocean, Oceanus the Titan, as anindividual, realistic human.  How would you represent a natural force such asthe wind, or an earthquake?  Would your representation be human?  Animal?<a href="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</a>?  <a href="glossary.html#NON-OBJECTIVE">NON-OBJECTIVE</a>? Explain your answer.<p>			<B>3.</B>	The artist who made this bronze boss <a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> it with silver and copper tomake it more valuable.  Today people still increase the value of objects byadding precious materials.  What are some examples?  <B>(Jewelry with preciousstones such as diamonds are more valuable than plain metals; coats with furtrim; floors inlaid with custom tile or stone; cars with leather upholstery; aceiling with <a href="glossary.html#GILDING">GILDED </a>or molded decoration.)  </B>Are there other ways we make thingsmore valuable?  <B>(Logos, designer names or sports SYMBOLS on clothing. Hand-madeitems are often more valuable than their machine-made counterparts.)</B><p>			<B>4.</B>	This bronze boss is a Roman interpretation of a Greek myth.  Is oneculture's interpretation of another's mythology an authentic interpretation?Why or why not? Would we consider this more genuine or legitimate if it hadbeen made by a Greek artist?  Why or why not?</ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide8.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide8.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide8.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
