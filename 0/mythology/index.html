The rich variety of images makes it possible for you to address a wide range of study areas, including language arts, humanities, art, social andcultural studies, and world religions.  <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a>will help you explore the relationships among the images.  Have funbeing creative with these materials!<br>  <p> <p> <p><b><center><font size=4>Image Essays and Discussion Questions</center></font size></b>Each image has a corresponding essay containing:<ul><li> Key points<li> The myth that inspired the work of art<li> Historical and cultural background information<li> Description of the work of art<li> Discussion of the style of the work of art<li> Suggested discussion questions</ul>All vocabulary words, in CAPITAL LETTERS in the essay, are defined in the<a href="glossary.html"><b>Glossary</b></a>.  Keep in mind that the essays are written for you - theeducator.  They are not intended to be read by or to your students.  Feel freeto adapt the information to the level of your students' needs.  You are thebest judge of what will be a useful supplement to your curriculum.<p>Suggested discussion questions accompany each essay.  <b>Look</b> questionsfocus on what can be gleaned from direct observation, while <b>Think</b>questions ask students to make hypotheses and draw conclusions.  The questionscan be easily adapted for any age. In general, younger students and those withlittle experience in the discipline of art will find <b>Look</b> questions mostinteresting.  Directions to the educator are printed in <b>boldface</b>.<p></ul><p><p><br><b><center><font size=4>General Thematic Questions and Discussion Points</center></font size></b><p>1.	Mythology often addresses the theme of good conquering evil.  How is this theme addressed in the stories in this collection of images?  Who or what represents good in these stories?  Who or what represents evil?  Which works of art focus on this conflict?  How?<p><p>2.	All the works of art in this collection of images were inspired by mythology.  Whatelse do they have in common?  How are they different?  Use the <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons</a> chart to select works of art for comparison. Youmight choose two works of art from the category of <a href="heromyths.html">Hero Myths</a>, for example, andcompare them in terms of media and technique, function, size, cultural origins,narrative, style, expressive quality, subject matter, or artistic intent.<p><p><b>Brainteaser:</b>  Do these works of art illustrate myths?  How?  How is anillustration different from other works of art?<p><b><center><font size=4>World Mythology Tours</font size></center></b><p>We hope that this collection of images will be useful as preparation for or follow-up to avisit to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  If you would like to reserve adocent-led tour, please call the Tour Office at (612) 870-3140 at least onemonth in advance.  <p><p>When you schedule a docent-led tour, your docent will contact you before yourtour date.  Since it is not possible for the museum to keep all works of art onview at all times, we recommend that you plan to discuss your particularinterests with your docent when she or he calls.  Because April and May are the museum's busiest months, we encourage you to schedule tours at other times of the year. <p>Now, if you're ready, begin exploring World Mythology with the <a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a>.<!--------Bottom Myth Menu------><p><hr></font></center> <table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a></center></table><hr><!--------Bottom Main Menu------><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
