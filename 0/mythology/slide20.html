Luana ate people.  The people left behindthe old woman Tsenabonpil, fearing that her severely swollen leg would sinktheir boat.<p>			Tsenabonbil gave birth to twin boys, Daror (DAH-roar) and Damuramurari(dah-moo-rah-moo-RAH-ree).  When they were older, Tsenabonpil told the boysthey must kill the evil pig, Luana.  After many adventures they managed tocapture and kill the pig.  Tsenabonpil then attached some of the pig's hair toa coconut and floated it out to the exiled Lesu people to let them know thatLuana was dead.<p>			When the Lesu people returned in their canoes, Tsenabonpil assigned themtheir social structure.  She designated the two marriage classes - the Eagle andthe Hawk - and gave names to the many clans.  She gave the Lesu knowledge of magic,medicine, and crafts.  When Tsenabonpil was done, she and her sons disappearedforever.</ul><hr><a name="Background"><center><b>Background</b></center></a><br><ul><b>New Ireland</b><br>	New Ireland is a province of Papua New Guinea (pop-poo-ahnoo GI-nee) and the second largest island in northwestMelanesia. It forms part of the Bismarck Archipelago.Tropical rainforests cover much of the island, and a wide variety of birds,reptiles, and sea animals live there.  Mammals are scarce, except formarsupials, pigs, and dogs.  The importance of the natural world to the peopleof New Ireland is evident in their traditional social structure, mythology,festivals, and art.<p><b>Malagan</b><br>		One of the central events in the social, economic, andaesthetic life of New Ireland communities is the malagan, a festivalheld in honor of deceased clan members.  The elaborate funeral rites andfestivities commemorate ancestors as well as help the souls of the dead departthe world of the living and acclimate to the world of the dead.  The malaganfestival, which may be held several months, or even years, after a person'sdeath, brings together large social groups and provides an opportunity for themoiety and clan to express solidarity.<p>			Elaborately carved sculptures are important aspects of the malagan festival.On the northern coast of New Ireland a clan member commissions a carver to makespecial sculptures to be revealed during festival performances.  Depending onthe number ordered, a single commission may take several months to complete.The ritual process of producing malagan sculptures is complex andtime-consuming; it is as much a part of the festivities as the performanceitself.  After the sculptures are carved and dried, they are placed in anenclosure built in or near the cemetery.  Sea-snail shells are placed into theeye sockets of the figures.  Only then can the sculptures be painted.<p>			The dramatic unveiling of the malagan figures at the end of the festivitiesis accompanied by generous feasts and dances at which the spirits of the deadare believed to be present.  The sculptures serve little or no practicalfunction after a festival and are often left to rot.  <p><img src="full_jpg/20.jpg" align=left hspace=8> <b>Malagan Pole</b><br>		Standing more than eight feet tall, this malagan pole ismade up of many intricately intertwined animals and humans.  At the top, a man crouches on a frigate bird, and at thebottom, a woman stands on the head of a wild pig.  In the middle of the pole is a complex <a href="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</a> design, called a mataling (MAH-ta-ling), or "eye of fire."  At its center is an eye<a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> with snail shell.  A pair of dark, elegantly decorated frigate birdsface the "eye of fire."  The lengthy tail feathers of the upper bird are heldby the man and blend into the feathers of another bird at the very top of thepole.  The lower bird's tail, held by the woman, hangs in front of the pig atthe bottom of the pole. <P>			White, orange-red, and black pigments are the main colors of this pole, andtraces of a bright yellow pigment are visible around the central design.  Whenthis pole was made, most pigments were still made from natural materials:white from lime powder, red from red ocher, black from charcoal ashes or burnednuts, and yellow from vegetable matter.<p><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="Thumbnails/20b.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=90 hspace=8>			The designs on the wild pig's head (see details) show the northern NewIreland painters' preference for breaking down large surface areas into small,decorative, patterned parts.  The boar's ears, eyelids, and long snout are allstriped.  Around its large white tusks are many small teeth, indicated byorange-red lines. <P><BR><b>Meaning</b><br>			The human figures on the malagan probably refer to ancestors, and the birdsto air; together they allude to the interrelatedness of all things.  Becauseeach malagan commemorates a specific individual in a particular ceremony, itsmeaning is known only to those present at that ceremony.  The same image maymean something different to everybody.  For example, to one person the pig atthe bottom might stand for the community's source of food and to another itmight recall the mythic story of the monstrous pig Luana.<br clear=left></ul><hr><center><B><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a> <br><UL><b>Look</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Tsenabonpil.  </b>The story of Tsenabonpil came from the people of New Ireland,the same people who made this <i>malagan</i> pole.
