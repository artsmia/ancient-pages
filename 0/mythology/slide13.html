At her birth a halo of light danced around her head.  Anexceptionally smart youngster, she studied with seven great scholars.Catherine soon surpassed all others in nobility, beauty, wealth, and knowledge.Her father died when she was only 14, leaving her in charge of the kingdom.Catherine declined, giving up the kingdom in order to pursue her studies.  Whenher loyal subjects begged her to reconsider and to marry, Catherine agreed, butinsisted that she would only marry a man who was her social and financialequal. Furthermore, he must be so beautiful that angels would wish to see him,and kind enough to forgive all offenses.  Her subjects feared that no one mancould fulfill all of these criteria.<p>			At this time a religious hermit saw in a vision that the Christian messiah,Jesus, was the husband Catherine sought.  The hermit shared this divine messagewith Catherine and gave her a picture of the baby Jesus with his mother, theVirgin Mary.  Upon seeing the child's face, Catherine knew she could love noone else.<p>			When Catherine asked the hermit how she could become worthy of Jesus, heinstructed her in the tenets of Christianity and baptized her.  That night shehad a dream in which the baby Jesus placed a wedding ring on her finger.  Whenshe awoke she found that the ring was still there.  From that moment onCatherine considered herself the bride of Jesus.    <p>			In the meantime, the Roman emperor Maxentius (mak-SEN-chus) had come toAlexandria.  Maxentius persecuted all those who refused to worship the idols inwhich he believed. Catherine challenged Maxentius.  He called in 50 of hisgreatest advisors to dispute with her, but they were no match for her wisdomand power of argument.  She converted them to Christianity.  The cruelMaxentius ordered his advisors burned to death, but he was so enchanted byCatherine's beauty that he spared her life.  Although he was already married hetried to force Catherine to marry him.  When she refused he tried to starve herinto submission.  Angels came to her dungeon cell and fed her.  WhenMaxentius's wife begged him to have mercy on Catherine, he had his wife put todeath and again tried to force Catherine into marriage. <p>			Furious at her repeated refusals, Maxentius ordered Catherine tied to fourspinning spiked wheels that would tear her apart.  A great flame flashed downfrom the heavens and burned the wheels, and their hot fragments killedCatherine's executioners. Finally Maxentius had Catherine beheaded.  Angelscarried her body to the top of Mount Sinai.  Maxentius soon died, himselfcondemned to a horrible death. <p></ul><hr><center><a name="Background"></A><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><p><b>Hypatia</b><br>			Many elements of the Saint Catherine legend are similar tothose of the life of an ancient philosopher named Hypatia (high-PAY-shuh).  During the 4th century, Alexandria, Egypt,was the Western world's intellectual, scientific, and philosophic center.  Itwas also the site of tremendous turmoil as Christianity gained political andintellectual power.  Although Hypatia taught so-called pagan philosophies inAlexandria, she was given special treatment by Christian leaders in the city.She died in 415, evidently murdered by a group of fanatical monks.   <p><p><b>Saint Catherine</b><br>			Whatever her origins, Saint Catherine of Alexandria was one of the most popular Christian saints in Europe during the laterMiddle Ages.  Jacobus de Voragine (ja-KOH-bus duh ve-RAJ-i-nee) popularized thestory of her martyrdom in his well-known collection of saints' lives, called<i>The Golden Legend</i>.  She was the patron saint of young girls,students, clergy, philosophers, and craftspeople, such as wheelwrights,spinners, and millers, whose work centered on the wheel.  Perhaps because ofher association with Hypatia, the Catholic Church considered Catherine'shistory unreliable and removed her from its calendar of saints in 1969. <p><b>Sculpture</b><br>		During the 14th century, artists regularly included SaintCatherine in large-scale altarpieces.  Rows of standing saints typicallyflanked a central figure of Christ or the Virgin Mary. These sculptures wereused to educate the illiterate and to inspire devotion.  <p>			Altarpiece saints were often carved from linden wood, also known aslimewood, which grew in the dense forests of southern Germany and Austria.Sculptors prized the expensive linden wood because its uniform grain enabledthem to carve out complex drapery patterns without cracking the wood.  Peoplebelieved that linden wood had magical qualities, and its leaves, seeds, andflowers were used in medicines.  Images were thought to be more powerful whencarved from this magical wood.<p><b>Saint Catherine of Alexandria</b><br>			This 15th-century linden wood sculpture from Austriaprobably stood in a large elevated altarpiece.  The back of thesculpture is hollowed out, indicating that only the front wasmeant to be seen. Catherine is depicted as a graceful young woman.  She standstall on the back of a small prone figure of Maxentius, showing the triumph offaith over evil.  Her crown indicates her royal status.  She raises her hand inblessing and looks down benevolently at the viewer.<p>			Catherine, renowned for her beauty, has long, wavy hair.  Her stocky bodyand her idealized facial features - small delicate red mouth, small sharp chin,long narrow nose, broad cheeks, and high forehead - are typical of Austrian andGerman Gothic representations of female saints.  Traces of paint indicate thather face was painted creamy white. She wears a fashionable 15th-centuryensemble of a high-waisted gown, loose outer cloak, and pointed shoes.  Tracesof color show that her cloak was once <a href="glossary.html#GILDING">GILDED</a> and the lining was painted blue.The red patches are remnants of the glue used to attach the <a href="glossary.html#GOLD">GOLD LEAF</a>.<p>			Catherine delicately lifts the hem of her cape as she steps over Maxentius.The folds of her voluminous drapery are crinkled and brittle.  Because of thesesharp, angular folds, the late Gothic manner in which she is carved is calledthe "hard style." </ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></a>Discussion Questions</b></center><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>  	<b>Tell the story of Saint Catherine.</b>  The artist who madethis sculpture used <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</a> to tell viewers about Catherine's life.  <b>Reviewthe meaning of symbol: something that stands for or represents another thing oridea.  </b>What does Catherine's crown symbolize? <B>(Royalty.)</B>  Can you find asymbol of the evil she overcame?

What is hard or sharp about it?  <B>(The sharp, angular folds ofCatherine's clothing.)</B><p>			<B>4.</B>	How big do you think this sculpture is?  <b>Discuss the sculpture'sfunction as part of an altarpiece, made to educate the illiterate and toinspire devotion.</b>  Does knowing this purpose change your size estimate?Explain.  <b>In order for people to see this on an altar, it would have to belarge.  Show an object or person of similar size to illustrate the large sizeof this sculpture - 63 inches.</b> <p><hr><BR><b>Think</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	Catherine of Alexandria was renowned for her beauty. Do youthink the woman represented in this sculpture is beautiful?  Why or why not?What is considered beautiful changes over time and is different for eachperson.  Saint Catherine's facial features are typical of German and AustrianGothic standards of beauty.  If you were to carve a sculpture of a beautifulperson, would it look different than Saint Catherine?  Would any of thefeatures be like Saint Catherine's?<p>			<B>2.</B>	Although it is not apparent in the image, the sculptor who carved SaintCatherine hollowed out the sculpture from the back and left the back open andunfinished.  Why? <B>(This sculpture was not meant to be viewed "in the round,"but rather set against a wall on an altar; the viewer wouldn't see the back.Also, a hollow sculpture is lighter in weight, easier to move, and less likelyto crack.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Even though Catherine died at the hands of Maxentius, Europeans duringthe Middle Ages considered her triumphant.  Why? <B> (Catherine represented thevirtue of defending one's beliefs, even in the face of death.  Her reward forher bravery, according to Christian mythology, was a place in the kingdom ofheaven.)<p></B>			<B>4.</B>	The story and sculpture of Saint Catherine tell us about the triumph ofgood over evil.
