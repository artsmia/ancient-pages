He slayed the mighty Minotaur (MIN-a-tor) in the Labyrinth of Crete(CREET), and repulsed an invasion of Athens by the Amazons, a race of femalewarriors. <p>			Pirithous (pi-RITH-oh-us), King of the Lapiths (LAP-iths), heard ofTheseus's reputation and wanted to see for himself if Theseus was indeed asbrave and clever as people said.  So, one day when Theseus was herding hiscattle near Marathon, Pirithous made a raid on his herd.  A fight brokeout at once. However, Pirithous overcome with admiration for Theseus,surrendered and humbly told him that he would accept any punishment Theseuschose.  But Theseus asked only for his friendship in return.<p>			Some time later, Pirithous invited his friend Theseus to his wedding toHippodamia (hippo-DAME-ee-ah).  Among the many wedding guests were the Centaurs(SEN-tars), neighbors of Piritho&uuml;s.  The Centaurs had the bodies of horsesand the torsos and heads of men.  They were an unruly bunch!  They drank toomuch wine and started to make trouble.  When they tried to kidnap Hippodamia,Theseus quickly intervened, defeating the Centaurs and saving his friend'sbride.<p></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><p><ul><b>Neoclassicism and Romanticism</b><br>	During the 18th century, the excavation of ancient<a href="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</a> ruins in the Roman cities of Herculaneum (her-cue-LANE-ee-um) and Pompeii (pom-PAY) inspired a revived interest in Greekand Roman art and ideas.  A new art style called neoclassicism developed.  Neoclassicism drew on the art of Greece andRome and favored themes drawn from classical myths.  <a href="glossary.html#NEOCLASSICISM">NEO-CLASSICAL</a> art favorsidealized forms, attention to detail, and careful rendering of surfacetextures.  It is calm and restrained. Male nudes are popular neoclassicalsubjects, and they express the ancient Greek concept of the ideal man as onewho, like Theseus, balances physical and intellectual prowess.<p>			Neoclassicism is often considered to be an early phase of the Romantic artmovement.  Romantic artists frequently looked to faraway places for theirsubject matter.  But, unlike neoclassical art, Romantic art tends to beflamboyantly theatrical and melodramatic.<p><b>Antoine-Louis Barye</b><br>	The theme of man and beast locked in struggle appealedto the Romantic French sculptor Antoine Louis (AN-twon LOO-ee)Barye, who specialized in animal sculpture.  Barye regularly studied andsketched living animals in a zoo as well as skeletons and preserved specimensin a natural history museum.  He observed dissections and read scholarly paperson a variety of species.  He was especially skilled at sculpting carnivorouscreatures attacking their prey.<p><b>Theseus Slaying a Centaur</b><br>		The power of Barye's Theseus Slaying a Centaurlies in the brilliant contrasts of man and beast.  Theseus isevery bit the mythological hero, powerful and restrained.  Hismouth tightly closed, he calmly looks down at the centaur, who grimaces inpain.  The line of the hero's body flows smoothly from his raised right arminto the curves of his out-thrust abdomen and bent knee.  In contrast, thecentaur's arms, legs, and tail extend in all directions.  As in ancient Greekstatues of athletes, Theseus's tight curls are idealistically controlled by ahead band, while the centaur's long mane flies wildly. <p>			The Romantic artists often depicted the turning point in a tale, as Baryedid in this sculpture.  Bayre captures the climactic moment when Theseus isabout to lower his club to destroy the writhing centaur.   The hero's grip onhis foe's throat and the centaur's hopeless effort to free himself create astrong sense of tension.  As Theseus digs his large toe into the centaur'sflank, the animal man stumbles and succumbs.  A curving length of cloth fallsfrom the centaur's back onto the foliage below them and through the beast'shind legs.  The sinuous flow of this cloth adds to the drama of the scene,while it also subtly counterbalances the angles created by the centaur's bentknee and right elbow and the raised elbow of Theseus.<p>			Barye endowed his figures with the meticulous, <a href="glossary.html#IDEALIZED">IDEALIZED</a> naturalism andattention to detail found in neoclassical sculpture, as well as with the highdrama and narrative focus of Romanticism.  Through these contrasts, Baryerepresents not only a specific moment from the myth of Theseus, but also thecontest of good against evil, the triumph of civilization over barbarism, andthe dominance of intellectual strength over brute force.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><p><ul><b>Look</b><br>		<B>1.</B>	Can you tell who will win this battle, just by looking at thesculpture?  <B>(The human figure: Theseus.)</B>  What visual clues has the artistgiven you to predict the outcome? <B>(Theseus is higher than the Centaur.Theseus's facial expression is calm and determined.  The Centaur appearspainful and frantic.  Theseus appears to have command of his body, while theCentaur's limbs and torso appear twisted and out of control.)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Theseus.</b>  In the story, Theseus represents goodand the Centaur represents the opposite, evil.  How has Barye made these twofigures look opposite in his sculpture?   <B>(Theseus's hair is neat and tidy; theCentaur's hair is wild and messy.  Theseus has open eyes and a closed mouth;the Centaur's eyes are closed and his mouth is open.  Theseus's body appearscentered and compact; the Centaur's limbs and tail fly out into space.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Where is most of the action taking place in this sculpture? <B>(In the areabetween the heads and shoulders of the two figures.)</B>  How has Barye directedour attention to this area?  <B>(Centaur's body is tilted upward and curves intothe area of the action.  The figures interlocking arms curve into each other.Theseus's raised arm suggests an implied movement toward the Centaur's head.Theseus gazes directly at the Centaur's head.)</B><p>			<B>4.</B>	Imagine that the limbs and bodies of these two figures are lines.  Whatkind of lines are they?  Are they thick or thin?  Are they smooth?  Jagged?Bumpy?  Do the lines curve, spiral, or are they straight?  Where do the linestouch each other?  Barye's sculpture implies movement and tension.  How do thequality and direction of the sculpture's lines contribute to the impliedmovement and tension?  <B>(Thick, smooth lines sharply curve or angle into oneanother, implying movement and tension where the lines interact.  The bodies ofthe figures can be seen as twisting or spiraling lines that add to the feelingof tension.)</B><p><B>5.</B>	<a href="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTIC</a> artists such as Barye paid a great deal of attention todetails.  Where can you see Barye's attention to detail in his sculpture ofTheseus and the Centaur? <B>(Musculature of the two figures; the Centaur's flowinghair, tail, and beard; the facial expressions of the figures.)</B><p><hr><BR><b>Think	</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Theseus and the Centaur.  </b>What partof the story did Barye choose to represent?  Why do you think he made thischoice?  Hint: Barye chose to represent this moment in the story because he wasinterested in the French <a href="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTIC</a> values of his time.  The Romantic <a href="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</a> inart was highly theatrical and flamboyant. <B>(Barye chose to represent the climaxof the story, the most active, exciting, and dramatic moment.)</B>  Think ofanother story you know.  What part of this story would you represent if youwere designing a sculpture in the Romantic style?<p><B>2.</B>	Sculptures are <a href="glossary.html#THREE-DIMENSIONAL">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</a>.  They take up real space, justlike you do.  When you look at Barye's sculpture in the classroom you areseeing a slide of it - an image projected on a <a href="glossary.html#TWO-DIMENSIONAL">TWO-DIMENSIONAL</a> screen. How elsecould you turn Barye's three-dimensional sculpture into a two-dimensionalimage?  <B>(Take a picture of it.  Make a drawing or painting of it.  Flatten itwith a steamroller!)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Barye was a sculptor who specialized in animals.  He studied animals atmuseums and zoos and liked to show them in dramatic poses.  What other storiescan you think of that Barye might be interested in? <B> (Red Riding Hood and theThree Little Pigs are confronted by a wolf.  The Hare and the Tortoise.Herakles and the Nemean Lion (see <i><a href="slide7.html">Hydria</a></i> entry).  Any storiesthat contain animals who perform dramatic feats.)</B><p><B>4.</B>	Discoveries of ancient ruins during the 18th century made Greek and Romanart and ideas very popular in Europe. Can you think of any modern discoveries,inventions, and technologies that have created a new interest in something?<B>(New technology created new interest in "video" pinball games.  New mediacreated a resurgence of interest in neon, Day-Glo colors, and glow-in-the-darknovelty items.  New recycling technology sparked an interest in recycling andgenerated recycling products.)</B><p></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide10.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide10.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide10.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
