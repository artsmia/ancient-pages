There, in a temple,lived an Indian priest named Wu Wei (woo way), who knew how to call forth thedragon who brings rain. The emperor begged Wu Wei to bring rain to his scorchedland. The priest refused.  The heat was seasonable, he said, and summoning thedragon would do much damage.  The emperor said that the people were sufferingbecause of the drought.  Any rain, he pleaded, even if accompanied by roaringwinds and crashing thunder, would be good.  Finally Wu Wei agreed. <p>			Wu Wei ordered everything from the temple except for one bowl of water to beremoved.  Stirring the water, he repeated magical words hundreds of times.Presently, a red finger-sized dragon appeared, raising its head slightly abovethe water's surface.  Then it slowly disappeared.  Wu wei stirred the wateragain, chanting a spell three times.  From the bowl a white vapor rose severalfeet into the air and floated toward the temple door.<p>			"Go," Wu Wei ordered the emperor's messenger, "for the rain is coming!"  Ashe fled to alert the emperor, the messenger glanced back to see the vapor rolllike white silk out of the temple.  Then darkness fell, bringing with itthunder and rain. Gale winds uprooted giant trees along the road as the stormovertook the terrified messenger.  At last he reached the emperor, drenched butsafe.<p></ul><hr><a name="Background"><center><b>Background</b></a></center><br><ul><p><b>Dragons</b> <br>		The Chinese dragon was a divine bringer of rain, necessaryfor the good of all.  The dragon was also a symbol of the good emperor whose wisdom and divine power assured the well-beingof his subjects.  Many legends draw connections between the dragon and theemperor.  Some emperors even claimed to have descended from the dragon.  For others, dragons were specialprotectors.	<p>			Chinese dragons could make themselves as large as the universe or as smallas a silkworm.  They could also change color and disappear in a flash.  Dragonswere rarely seen because they cleverly hid in caves burrowed into the loftymountains, or coiled up on the bottom of the deepest seas.  Any sighting of adragon boded well - it meant that Heaven was letting the people know that theirruler was doing a good job.  Obviously, rulers were eager to hear of anyreports of dragons in their domain.    <p><b>Ch'ing Dynasty</b><br>	In 1644, the nomadic Manchu (man-CHEW) warriors fromnorthern China overthrew China's Ming rulers and established the Ch'ingdynasty.  The Manchu admired and quickly adopted the culture and government ofthe native Chinese they had conquered.  Still, in their official clothingstyles, the Manchu emphasized their own distinctive cultural heritage.Inspired by the riding garments of their nomadic days, Ch'ing robes had longtapered sleeves, tight cuffs, narrow neck openings, side closures, and slitskirts.  Although the cut was new, Ch'ing robes were decorated with symbolsfrom traditional Chinese mythology, most notably the dragon.<p>			Everyone who attended and served at court during the Ch'ing dynasty woresymbolic robes.  Rank and status within the court were indicated by the cut,color, and symbolic decoration of one's robe.  The highest rank was that ofemperor, empress, or empress dowager.  Only they were allowed to wear yellowrobes bearing the five-toed dragon <a href="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIF</a> (moe-TEEF).<p><b>Dragon Robe</b><br>		This type of semiformal court robe is called<i>ch'i-fu</i> (chee-foo), which translates as "festivedress."  The color and cut indicate that this robe was worn by an empress.  <p><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="Thumbnails/22a.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=129 hspace=8><b>Description</b><br>		The dragon on this robe (see detail) is a distinctive typeassociated with the emperor.  Its wide, flat head is topped by horns andflanked by wiry whiskers.  Scales and sharp spines cover its curving body.Five short legs with powerful claws emerge from the dragon's snakelike torso.Flames spark outward from its joints.  The dragon tosses a flaming pearlbetween its claws.  <p>			The dragon cavorts in a celestial landscape above a rainbow-hued diagonalocean whose frothy waves crash against three rocky mountains, all of whichrepresent the earth.  The heavens are represented by a band of colorful<a href="glossary.html#STYLIZED">STYLIZED</a>, stringy clouds that curl on top of the waves and float up in littleovals through the robe.<br clear=left><BR><b>Symbols</b>	<br>	The dragon is the centerpiece of an elaborate set of imagesthat symbolize the emperor's authority as an intermediary in the universalorder between heaven and earth.  The great and beneficial power of the dragoncould be brought to the people by the good governance of the emperor.  Thepearl within the dragon's grasp is a symbol of wisdom.  Like a worthy emperor,the dragon always seeks wisdom.<p>			Many symbols of good luck and power surround the dragon. The whole<a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a> is embroidered with an intricate <a href="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</a> of connected bright blueswastikas.  In China the swastika symbolized good luck and the number 10,000.Thus any symbol of blessing laid against it is multiplied 10,000 times. Severalred bats fly through the heavens below the dragon.  Bats wereconsidered emblems of longevity and happiness because the words for happinessand bat sound similar.  To either side of the dragon's head are red stylized<i>shou</i> (show) characters, which wish long life for the robe's wearer.</ul><hr><center><B><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</B></center></a><br><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Wu Wei and the dragon.  </b>The dragon frequently appears on Chinese court robeslike this one as a <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</a> for the emperor's power to mediate between heaven andearth for the well-being of the people.
