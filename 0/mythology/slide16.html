Helived with his parents and two siblings in a small cottage. Herbert's parentsdied - his father from typhoid fever and his mother from pneumonia - when he wasvery young.  In 1884, 10-year-old "Bertie" moved to Oregon to live with hisuncle, a country doctor.  At 17, he entered Stanford University, from which hegraduated with a degree in engineering.  <p>			Hoover became a very successful mining engineer, making his fortuneoperating mines in San Francisco, England, Australia, and China.  When WorldWar I broke out, Hoover established the American Relief Committee in London atthe request of the United States government, helping more than 100,000Americans to escape war-torn Europe.  Later he chaired the Commission forRelief in Belgium and served as the United States Food Administrator.  Afterthe war, he created the American Relief Administration, administering more than100 million dollars for clothing and food for oppressed Europeans and Russiansrecovering from German occupation.  When government funds for that program ranout, Hoover secured private contributions to keep it going.    <p>			Hoover's dedication to relief efforts made him a hero.  Both politicalparties wanted him to become their presidential candidate.  He ran for a timein the 1928 Democratic primaries, but was ultimately victorious as a Republicancandidate. Recognizing the political advantage of his popular rags-to-richesstory, Hoover kicked off his campaign with a big public rally in his ruralhometown.  In 1929 the poor orphan boy from Iowa became president of the UnitedStates.<p></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><b>Grant Wood</b><br> 		The artist Grant Wood is something of a legend himself,another small-town Iowa boy made good.  Wood studied art in Europe for several years but returned to the United States in the1920s. Dissatisfied with modern painting styles, he developed his own styleinspired by the brilliant colors and tiny details of 15th-century Flemishpaintings. <p>			Responding to a resurgence of nationalism and a new fascination with theAmerican past, Wood painted many <a href="glossary.html#GENRE">GENRE</a> scenes of historical and regionalinterest, including farmhouses, small-town folk, and the rural landscape.  Heand other midwestern artists who painted scenes of Americana were calledRegionalists.  Wood emphasized description and narrative in the same way as thecontemporary American writers he admired. Like Sinclair Lewis, he raisedordinary experiences of daily life to mythical proportions. <p><b>The Birthplace of Herbert Hoover, West Branch, Iowa</b><br>			Wood places the viewer at the crest of a steep hill,looking down into a green valley where a tour guide points toa small cottage beside a larger white house.   But this isnot an ordinary cottage - it is the place where Herbert Hoover wasborn.  <br><br>			Warm midwestern sunshine illuminates the large family homes, neatly mownlawns, and perfectly clipped trees in the quiet neighborhood surrounding thecottage.  A gentle breeze blows laundry hanging near the cottage.  In thefront, three orange birds fly over a clear blue stream.  Beyond them, toylikechickens peck around logs leaning against a red barn, and even farther back,two boys in overalls chat on the sidewalk.  A road runs between rows of shadetrees on the right, and a golden field, dotted with haystacks, extends beyondthe houses on the left.  <p>			Typical of Grant Wood's Regionalist style, everything is neat andregimented, evoking the simplified forms of American folk art.  Forms, such asthe solid, rounded trees and boxlike houses, are reduced to <a href="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</a> shapes.Many tiny straight brushstrokes define the trim lawns, creating a rhythmicpattern across much of the painting, and patterned clumps of enormous autumnalleaves define the trees.  Unrealistically, all of the forms, whether close ordistant, are bathed in the same clear light and described with the same precisedetail.  <p>			Warm autumnal colors - browns, golds, oranges, and yellow-greens - dominateWood's painting.  The white siding of the cottage and house create a strikingcontrast against the golden-green lawn.<p><b>Hoover's Birthplace</b><br>		Wood did not re-create the scene as it may have looked at the president's birth.  Instead he painted it as the touristattraction it became.  Upon Hoover's election to the presidency, the ordinarycottage, which had been turned into a kitchen by later owners, began to attractvisitors from all over the country.  Theowner of the cottage charged visitors ten cents for tours of it and set up asouvenir stand.  Wood included a sign in front of the house and a pink rock inwhich the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a plaque identifying thehouse as Hoover's birthplace.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Herbert Hoover.  </b>What part of thestory do you see in Grant Wood's painting?  <B>(Herbert Hoover's birthplace.)</B>Herbert Hoover was born in West Branch, Iowa, in 1874.

Who is thetour guide pointing the way for?  <B>(You - the viewer of the painting!)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	Grant Wood's <a href="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</a> can be compared to American folk art because of theway he simplified forms in his paintings.  What forms did he simplify in thispainting? <B>(Trees and shrubs are solid round shapes rather than irregular asthey are in nature, and the houses are boxlike.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Grant Wood created <a href="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</a> in his painting by repeating lines and forms.Where do you see repeated lines?  <B>(The leaves of the trees and shrubs are madeup of regular repeated lines.  The lawn is painted with tiny repeated lines.)</B>Where do you see repeated forms that create pattern?  (Tops of trees, treetrunks and shadows that line the road on the right, rounded forms of shrubs tothe left of the bridge, haystacks in the <a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a> on the left.)<p>			<B>4.</B>	What time of year is it in Grant Wood's painting?  <B>(Late summer.)</B>  Howcan you tell?  <B>(Lush greens, some leaves beginning to turn fall colors.)</B>  Whattime of day is it? (Morning.)  How can you tell?  <B>(Shadows indicate sun is atan angle.  Bright light indicates sun is growing stronger rather than fadinginto evening sunset.)</B><p>			<B>5.</B>	Artists use several <a href="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE">PERSPECTIVE</a> techniques to give their work theillusion of depth.  Which techniques did Grant Wood use?  <B>(Objects closest tothe viewer appear larger.  Objects far away appear smaller and closer to thehorizon line [scale]; objects closest to the viewer overlap and partially hideobjects in the distance [overlap]; objects recede along imaginary lines thatmeet at a "vanishing point" on the horizon line [linear <a href="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE">PERSPECTIVE</a>].)</B>  Whichtechnique didn't he use? <B> (Distant objects have less detail and mutedgray-toned colors compared to objects close to the viewer [<a href="glossary.html#AERIAL">AERIALPERSPECTIVE</a>].)</B><p>			<B>6.</B>	Grant Wood was a <a href="glossary.html#GENRE">GENRE</a> painter.  He was interested in painting scenesfrom everyday life in the midwestern United States.  What is "everyday" aboutthe scene in this painting?  <B>(Chickens in the yard, children playing, laundryhanging on the clothesline.)</B>  What is not "everyday?"  <B>(Tour guide and signagesignify an extraordinary place; yard and road excessively neat and ordered.)</B><p><hr><BR><b>Think</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	What popular American myth does Herbert Hoover's storyexemplify?  <B>(Anyone can grow up to become president of the United States.)</B>  Doyou think this myth holds true even today?  Could a girl grow up to bepresident of the United States?  Does a person's race play a part in his or herability to achieve the presidency?  Is it easier to become president if you arewealthy?  Why or why not?<p>			<B>2.</B>	Grant Wood's painting of Herbert Hoover's humble beginnings shows howextraordinary things can happen to ordinary people.  Can you think of otherordinary people in American history who were able to make extraordinaryachievements?  <B>(Abraham Lincoln, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks,Amelia Earhart, George Washington Carver, Howard Hughes . . . the list is endless!)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Grant Wood was a member of a group of American painters called<a href="glossary.html#REGIONALISM">REGIONALISTS</a>.  These artists tried to show the distinctive characteristics of aregion of the United States in their paintings.  What particularcharacteristics of the American Midwest did Grant Wood include in his paintingof Herbert Hoover's birthplace? <B>(Flat rural landscape, wooden farm buildings,deciduous trees and changing seasons.)</B>  How would his painting look differentif Herbert Hoover had been born in the southwest United States?  In Colorado?In Florida?<p>			<B>4.</B>	Grant Wood and his contemporaries in American art in the 1930s and 1940swere interested in raising ordinary experiences of everyday life to mythicproportions. How did Grant Wood raise everyday life in the town of HerbertHoover's birthplace to mythic proportions?  <B>(He made a painting about it!)</B><b>Explain that before this particular period of American history, artists andwriters did not consider daily life important enough to write about orrepresent in works of art.</b>  Can you think of other artists or writers youmay have studied whose work focused on daily life? <B> (Sinclair Lewis, RobertFrost, John Steinbeck, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Mark Twain, Edward Hopper, ThomasHart Benton.)<p></B></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide16.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide16.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide16.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
