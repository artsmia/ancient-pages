He was considered very ugly.  Hopingto advance his career, he took the examinations required to enter governmentservice.  Although he performedbrilliantly, Shoki's dreams of advancement were shattered.  Some say Shoki wascruelly cheated out of first place.  Others say he was awarded first place bythe examiners, who praised his work, saying it was equal to that of the wisestancients.  But when Shoki was presented to the court, the emperor rejected himbecause he was so ugly.<p>			In shame, Shoki took his own life on the steps of the imperial palace, rightin front of the emperor.  Overcome with remorse, the emperor ordered that Shokibe buried with the highest honors, wrapped in a green robe usually reserved formembers of the imperial clan.  In gratitude, Shoki's spirit vowed to protectany ruler against the evil of demons.<p></ul><hr><center><a name="Background"><b>Background</b></a></center><br><ul><b>Japan and China</b><br>	When the Japanese imported Buddhism from China in the 6th century, they also assumed many other aspects of Chinese culture, including their mythology.  The popular story ofShoki was adopted from China, where he was known as Chung Kuei (chungguay).  During the Edo (ED-oh) period in Japan (1600-1868), families began to hang banners depicting Shokiinside and outside of their houses during the Boys' Day festival. Boys' Day iscelebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar year.  According toancient tradition, this is a day when evil spirits and bad luck abounds.Images of Shoki ward off danger from the homes of families with male children.<p><b>Rising Merchant Class</b><br>		During Japan's Edo period, great cities and a new, prosperous	merchant class flourished.  Middle-class tastes weresignificantly different from those of the Buddhist priests and shogunate (thegovernment under a shogun) that had dominated artistic patronage in the past.Members of the new middle class preferred scenes of everyday life andillustrations of folk stories like Shoki the Demon Queller.  By the 18thcentury many artists depicted Shoki in prints for this new audience.  <p><b>Prints</b>	<br>		As a result of this new patronage and the development of amany-colored woodblock printing process, an abundance of printed materials weremade available to all.  Novels, pictures,and poetry helped inform the Japanese of their own cultural heritage as well asartistic styles and themes imported from China.  For commoners who could notafford a painting, these new prints offered an affordable alternative.  <p>			The long narrow format of <a href="glossary.html#PILLAR">PILLAR PRINTS</a>, achieved by pasting together twosheets of paper, was popular and practical. Whereas most prints were pastedinto albums, pillar prints were hung in the home.  The traditional Japanesehouse had very few walls, and the sliding doors that divided the rooms weremade of paper.  Structural wooden pillars were the only place where picturescould be hung.  <p><b>Masanobu</b>	<br>	The artist Masanobu (maa-saw-no-boo) (1686-1764) invented thepopular pillar print format.  He was one of Japan's most important painters andprintmakers during the 18th century.  By his own account, Masanobu wasresponsible for dozens of technical and stylistic innovations in printmaking.<p><b>Shoki, the Demon Queller</b><br>		Shoki typically appears as a portly bewhiskered man.  Hewears scholar's robes, a hat, and heavy knee-high boots andcarries a large sword.  His large eyes, bulbous nose, and fierceexpression are also characteristic features.  In this print Shoki rounds acorner in hot pursuit of a demon.  His eyes bulge out as he spies his prey.His left hand tenses, while his right reaches for his long broad sword.<p>			Masanobu deftly varies his use of line to convey mood, texture, and mass.The thick, wavy, jagged outlines of Shoki's drapery capture his intensevitality.  The fine delicate lines of his wild windblown beard and haircontrast the thicker lines of his bushy eyebrows and mustache.  Masanobu usesdramatic shading in light and dark to emphasize the bulk of the figure.<p>			Masanobu creatively uses this narrow vertical format to enhance hisstorytelling.  Shoki does not fill the length of the print, but is relegatedinstead to the lower two-thirds.  This position emphasizes his short and portlystature.  By cropping from view much of Shoki's arms, one leg, and the ends ofhis hair and beard, Masanobu gives the impression of catching a quick glimpseof the elusive demon queller.<p>			The characters (the <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</a> used in the Japanese writing system) placed inthe lower left corner of this pillar print of Shoki, are the artist Masanobu'sstudio name, Hogetsudo (hoe-get-sue-doe), and his signature, Okumura BunkakuMasanobu (oh-ku-mer-ah boon-ka-ku maa-saw-no-boo).</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a> <br><ul><b>Look</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of <i>Shoki, the Demon Queller</i>.</b>What is Shoki doing in this picture?  <B>(Running!)</B>  Can you find his sword?<B>(Hangs down to the left of his boot.)</B>  <b>Explain the format of <a href="glossary.html#PILLAR">PILLAR PRINTS</a>,made to hang on narrow pillars in a traditional Japanese home. </b> Why wouldOkumura Masanobu <a href="glossary.html#CROP">CROP</a> off part of Shoki's body when he made this print?  <B>(Togive the impression of a fleeting glimpse of Shoki on the move.)

Shoki's spirit was grateful for theemperor's remorse and belated respect.  Do you think Shoki should have beengrateful?  Why or why not?

Was it easy to forgive?<p>			<B>2.</B>	During the Edo period in Japan, families hung pictures of Shoki insideand outside their houses to protect their male children during the Boys' Dayfestival.  Why do you suppose Shoki came to be considered protection for boys?<B>(Perhaps because Shoki's real life role of scholar and his afterlife role asprotectorate were male-dominated roles in Japan, roles considered inappropriatefor girls or women.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	During the Edo period, <a href="glossary.html#PRINT">PRINTS</a> like this one were popular among theJapanese middle class because they were an affordable alternative to originalpaintings.
