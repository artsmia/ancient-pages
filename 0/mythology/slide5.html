Down this chain climbed Oduduwa,Olorun's son.  Oduduwa brought with him a handful of dirt, a special five-toedchicken, and a palm nut.   He threw the dirt upon the ancient waters and setthe chicken on the dirt.  The chicken busily scratched and scattered the dirtuntil it formed the first dry earth.  In the center of this new world, Oduduwacreated the magnificent Ife (EE-fay) kingdom.  He planted the palm nut, whichgrew into a proud tree with 16 branches, symbolizing the 16 sons and grandsonsof Oduduwa.<br><br>			Oduduwa was the first ruler of the kingdom and the father of all Yoruba.Over time he crowned his 16 sons and grandsons and sent them off to establishtheir own great Yoruba kingdoms.  As descendants of the sky god, these firstYoruba rulers and their direct descendants were divine kings.  Only they couldwear special veiled crowns that symbolized their sacred power.<br></ul><hr><a name=Background></A><center><b>Background</b></center>	<ul><br><b>The Yoruba</b><br>The Yoruba peoples of West Africa have lived in the  southwestern area of what are now Nigeria and the Republic of Benin (BE-neen) since the 11th century.  The earliestYoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo (oh-YO) spread over vast territories. Divinekings, descendants of Oduduwa, ruled these kingdoms, advised by councils ofelders and chiefs.  As part of their royal <a href="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</a>, kings wore distinctivebeaded veiled crowns.  <p><b>Crowns</b><br>The beaded veiled crown, called <i>adenla</i> ("great crown"),is more than a symbol of kingship.  Each crown embodies ideals of political andpersonal stability, refuge for the oppressed, salvation, and much more.  Wornonly on ceremonial occasions, the crown gave the king the power to communicatewith his spirit ancestors in order to benefit his people.  At other times itwas kept on display and given the same respect and attention as the kinghimself.  Because these crowns hold so much power, they are among the mostsacred Yoruba objects.<p>			Beginning in the 1830s, civil wars disrupted the Yoruba kingdoms.  From the1890s until the 1960s, British and French interference further challengedtraditional Yoruba ways.  In this climate of political upheaval, Yoruba leaderswithout official claims to kingship began to commission and wear veiled crowns.Although the sacred powers of Yoruba kings are limited today, disputes stillrage over the rights to wear veiled crowns.<p><b>King's Crown</b><br>This 19th-century king's crown is made of thousandsof tiny brightly colored glass beads.  Many features of this crown arecharacteristic of nearly all sacred Yoruba crowns. <p><b>Veil</b><br>The most distinctive feature of this crown is the veil of beadsthat once cascaded over the king's face.  A net of black, white, maroon, andblue beads is surrounded by multicolored strands of beads.  The veil obscuredthe king's features to protect men and women from looking directly at his facewhen he was united with his powerful ancestors.  <p><b>Face</b><br>A great yellow face dominates the crown.  Its black-and-whitealmond-shaped eyes, yellow nose, and oval blue mouth are raised from thesurface.  The three vertical lines on either side of the nose are scarsdenoting the king's lineage.  The face represents a royal ancestor of the king,probably Oduduwa, and unites the spirit world of the ancestors with the earthlyworld of the king and his people.<p><b>Projection</b><br>A tall striped projection, perhaps representing a hairstyle,stands above the face.  Among some Yoruba, projections from the heads ofspecial individuals signify spiritual power.  The projection on this crown oncecontained a pouch of herbal medicines that gave the crown its power.  For fearhe would be blinded, even the king could not look inside his own crown.    <p><b>Birds</b><br>Sixteen colorful beaded birds surround the king's crown. Thesebirds signify a divine force called <i>&agrave;she</i> (ah-SHE)--the power tomake things happen--which only the highest Yoruba men and women possess.  Thebirds connote the &agrave;she of the king and of a group of elderly womencalled "the mothers" who support him.  Themothers' special power enables them to turn into night birds who punish ordestroy those who are arrogant, selfish, or otherwise immoral.  On the crown,the birds symbolize the king's power and the mothers' power to protect him andthe people.</ul><p><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell or read the story of Oduduwa</b>.  What aspects of thestory do you see on the crown?  <B>(The face may represent a king's ancestor orOduduwa himself.)</B>  Does knowing the story of Oduduwa help you to understandwhat you see on the crown?  What questions do you have about the crown'sappearance that weren't answered by the story?<p>			<B>2.</B>	What is this crown made of?  <B>(Glass beads.)</B>  Make a shopping list of allthe bead colors you would need to make this crown.  Look carefully at the<a href="glossary.html#TEXTURE">TEXTURE</a> of the King's crown.  If you could touch it, how would it feel?Smooth?  Rough?  Soft?  Bumpy?  Sticky? <b>Encourage students to agree on morethan one adjective to describe the crown's texture.</b><p>			<B>3.</B>	The beads that were applied to the surface of the crown are of uniformshape, size, and <a href="glossary.html#TEXTURE">TEXTURE</a>, yet the artist used the beads to define differentobjects and features on the crown.  How did he do it?  <B>(Different colors,<a href="glossary.html#LINEAR">LINEAR</a> rows of beads running in various directions, some applied to pieces thatproject out from the surface of the crown.)</B><p> 				Where has the artist varied the direction of the rows of beads to defineobjects or features?  <B>(The black outline around the yellow face, lips, andeyes; birds' eyes are circular against vertical rows of beads on the birdheads; connecting rows of beads on the fringe to form a diagonal pattern wherethe veil would cover the king's face.)</B><p>				Where has the artist used color to define objects and features on thecrown?  <B>(Lips and eyes.  Entire face is a different color from the background.Birds are defined by red beaks and white and black eyes.  Bands of yellow beadsoutline some of the wings.)</B>  Some beaded parts of the crown are raised slightlyto help define features. Where are they?  <B>(Eyes, nose, and lips on the face.)</B><p><hr><b>Think</b><br><B>1.</B>	The Yoruba king's crown identifies the wearer as a king andgives him special powers to interact with the spirit world for the benefit ofhis people.  Can you think of special headgear that people wear today thatidentify their role or status in the community?  <B>(Some examples: police hats,fire fighters' helmets, graduation caps, military hats, bridal veils, chef'shats, bishop's miters, yarmulkes, any other religious head wear.)</B><p><p>				In some cases these hats symbolize special powers the wearers have.  Dothese hats ever give supernatural power to their owners?  If notsupernatural power, what kind of power might these people get from wearingspecial headgear?  <B>(No right answer!)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	<b>Bring in pictures of some other examples of courtly attire from avariety of cultures.</b>  Why do you think rulers or important people invarious cultures wear this kind of <a href="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</a>?  <B>(So that people can identify them,to follow tradition, to appear wealthy and powerful, to link them with rulersof the past.)  <p></B>				Do rulers or important people dress this way every day? On what occasionsdo they wear their full regalia?  When you dress up for special occasions, whatdoes your outfit tell people about you?<p>			<B>3.</B>	The birds on the crown represent a group of wise elder women.  They are<a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</a> of the king's ability to deal with the forces of evil.  Why might thebirds be placed on the king's crown as opposed to other parts of the king's<a href="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</a>?  <B>(A Yoruba king uses the wisdom of these elder women to benefit hispeople.  The symbols of the elders appear to surround the king's head, anadvantageous location for imparting wisdom.  Birds on the king's crown are easyfor his subjects to see.  The king's crown is the most sacred and powerful ofall royal Yoruba objects and so is an honored location reserved for symbols ofthe other powerful members of the community.)</B><p>			<B>4. </B>	Some people think objects like this king's crown should be kept inmuseums for everyone to learn from and enjoy, even though they were neverintended to be displayed that way.  Others think that objects like these aretreasures of the cultures they came from and should be returned.  What do youthink?  Explain your answer. <B>(No right answer.)</B><p></ul><hr><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide5.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide5.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide5.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><!--------Bottom Main Menu------><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
