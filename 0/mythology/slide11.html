Orpheus became a great musician. His voice was moremelodious than any other mortal's. The songs he sang and the tunes he playedon his lyre enchanted gods, mortals, and beasts alike; even stones and treescame to him when he played.<br><br>Orpheus married the beautiful nymph Eurydice. But on their wedding day apoisonous snake bit her and she died. Desperate to be reunited with hisbeloved Eurydice, Orpheus journeyed to the Underworld to beg the king andqueen there to return Eurydice to him. As he sang his plea and played hislyre, even the cold spirits of the Underworld wept. The king and queengranted the couple permission to leave together on the condition thatOrpheus must not look back at Eurydice until they were both completely outof the Underworld. Silently they made the arduous, dark climb. But at theopening to the world, Orpheus, in his love for Eurydice, turned and lookedat her. She slipped back into the darkness.<br><br>Orpheus returned to his world, where his music became even more moving,reflecting his suffering over the loss of Eurydice. He wandered despondentthrough the woods and refused the love of other women. This so angered thelocal women that they tore Orpheus to pieces and tossed his head and lyreinto the river. Still singing out the name of Eurydice, his head floated outto sea. Orpheus's spirit returned to the Underworld, where he was happilyreunited with Eurydice.<br><br></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><b>Orpheus</b><br> Although many well-known ancient writers wrote about Orpheus, hishistory is muddled. By the 5th century B.C., the Greeks considered Orpheus the founder of an early religion and areligious teacher. His mythology and fame as a singer derived from sacredtexts ascribed to him.<br><br>The Orpheus myth warns that death is inevitable, that even the power of songcannot save one from death. But it also reconciles life and death,suggesting that death is actually the beginning of a new life.<br><br>Since ancient times, Orpheus has represented the supreme power of poetry andmusic to enchant all natural things. It was Orpheus the musician whoattracted the painter Maurice Denis.<br><br><b>Maurice Denis and the Symbolists</b><br>  Early in his career, Denis associated with a group ofartists called Symbolists. The Symbolists challengedthe value of naturalism as an artistic goal. Instead, they usedbright and often arbitrary colors, curving lines, flat forms, and unusualcompositions to transform the real world into personal symbolic statements.<br><br>The Symbolists sought an ideal synthesis of the arts. Maurice Denis'spaintings incorporated elements and themes from the other arts; he believed,for example, that painting could have musical qualities and that color,line, and form were inherently musical and could convey a sense of rhythmand harmony. Denis collaborated with writers, poets, composers, performers,and critics. Among Denis's many interdisciplinary projects was a 1912-13series of paintings on the history of music, including an image of Orpheus,in the Theatre des Champs-Elysees (tay-AH-truh day SHANZ-ay-leez-ay) inParis.<br><br>Orpheus and his mythology represented the vital synthesis of poetry, music,and the other arts, so important to Denis and his Symbolist colleagues.Orpheus's reputation as a religious and artistic teacher also endeared himto artists of this era who, like Denis, were interested in the spiritualqualities of art.<br><br>Orpheus and In the painting Orpheus and Eurydice Denis uses rich and pale Eurydice greens, purples, browns, whites, and blues to evoke an idyllicmoment of humans in harmony with nature. It is a beautiful spring day with abright blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and a blanket of lush green andlavender flowers. No single figure dominates. Even Orpheus does not takecenter stage; rather, he stands to the right, playing his lyre and charmingall who have gathered to hear him. He wears a laurel crown, a cherishedprize in ancient Greece, awarded to the best poets and musicians.<br><br>Denis believed that a truly harmonious painting was one that achieved abalance between nature and imagination. Artists had to be able to rationallyorganize their emotional responses to nature in their art. He achieves thatbalance in this painting. Orpheus's white-clad audience, from the frontmostreclining woman to the embracing couple on the right, forms an open-endedcircle around the musician. By gradually reducing the size of the figures,Denis guides the viewer back into the forest. Kneeling beneath an archedbower in the painting's <a href="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</a>, Eurydice raises her hands in approvalof Orpheus's song. The sequence of figures creates a gentle rhythm thatcarries through the picture. The vertical trees impose a subtle restraint onthe scene, though even they, like the standing Orpheus, curve gently,contributing to the overall harmony.<br><br>Denis's harmonious painting only hints at the tragedy that would befall thelovers. By isolating Eurydice under the hedge, he physically separates herfrom all of the other figures.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b></center><br><B>1.</B>  Tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.
