They floated for many days andnights until the wind and waves carried them to the shores of Provence insouthern France.  The local people did not share the beliefs of the castawaysand refused them food and shelter.  The tattered group finally found refuge ina temple.  There, Mary and Martha preached the word of Jesus, performedmiracles, and converted thousands of the people to their faith.    <p>			Mary regretted many of the things she had done in her youth. Wishing torepent, she devoted herself to a life of solitary contemplation in thewilderness.  For thirty years she lived as a hermit in a cave prepared for herby angels.  Over time, her clothes rotted away and her hair grew and grew untilit covered her entire body.  <p>			During the last years of Mary's life, a host of angels lifted her toward theheavens seven times a day.  One day a local priest witnessed this event.  Maryidentified herself to the dumbstruck priest and sent him to tell the bishop tolook for her on a specified day.  On that day the bishop forgave Mary for thesins of her youth.  Mary then died and her soul rose to heaven. After herdeath, Mary continued to perform miracles for those who prayed to her.<p></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><b>Mary Magdalene</b><br> 	Mary of Magdala, better known as Mary Magdalene, is referredto in Mark's gospel in the Bible's New Testament as the woman from whom Jesus cast seven devils (16:9).  Mark alsoidentifies her as one of three Marys who anoint Jesus' body after hiscrucifixion (16:1), and as the first person Jesus sees after his resurrection(16:9).  Later traditions identified her as the unnamed prostitute described inLuke's gospel who was forgiven her sins by Jesus, after she washed his feetwith her tears and dried them with her hair (7:36).  During the Middle Ages,Mary Magdalene came to exemplify the faithful and repentant sinner. She stoodas a message to Catholic believers that no one, except the devil, is beyondforgiveness and redemption.  By 1500, during the age of the CounterReformation, pictures of Mary Magdalene came to represent the Roman CatholicChurch itself, whose excesses could also be forgiven through Christ's love.  <p><b>Saints</b><br>			The story of Mary Magdalene's work, exile, and death wasrecounted in a popular 13th-century collection of stories called <i>The GoldenLegend</i> by Jacobus de Voragine (ja-KOH-bus duh ve-RAJ-i-nee).  <i>The GoldenLegend</i> was essentially a layperson's version of the lectionaries, or livesof the saints, which were read on each saint's feast day during the year.  Asan archbishop of Genoa, Voragine was familiar with these texts known chiefly tochurch clerks.<p>			The saints - the heroes of the Middle Ages and Renaissance - were role modelsof perfection, possessing divine wisdom, super strength, and unwaveringdevotion.  These exemplars of Christian virtues frequently appeared inaltarpiece paintings, inspiring worshipers to emulate their behavior.    <p><b>The Elevation Elevation of the Magdalen</b><br>	Peter Strub's (stroob) painting <i>The Elevation Elevation of the Magdalen</i> shows Mary, covered with hair, being lifted up by 14angels.  A golden halo surrounds her idealistically youthfulface, which shows no signs of her 30-year stay in the wilderness.  Herabundantly flowing red hair is a common <a href="glossary.html#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTE</a>, referring to her humbledrying of Jesus' feet.  Far less typical is the animal-like fur that coversmuch of her idealized body. Mary folds her hands over her chest, which is notcovered by fur.  Her knees are also exposed, all hair evidently worn away fromkneeling in constant prayer.  The angels discreetly cover her lower abdomenwith a crisply draped cloth.  From the mountainous landscape below, a priestlooks up at the miraculous vision.<p><b>Style</b><br>			Peter Str&uuml;b's tempera painting <i>The Elevation of theMagdalen</i> is for the most part typical of German Renaissance art.  The flatgold <a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</a>, a characteristic feature of medieval art, remained a populartradition in religious painting well into the Renaissance.  The gold suggeststhat the subject is holy and bathed in heavenly light.  By contrast, thedetailed landscape below Mary is very much a part of the earthly realm.Typical of German painters of his era who rendered their native landscape ingreat detail, Strub painted Mary Magdalene in a mountainous Germanlandscape, rather than in southern France. Fine realistic details abound, fromthe leafy trees and craggy rocks to the individual hairs of Mary's fur suit andthe soft feathers of the angels' wings.  This attention to detail is one of themost characteristic traits of German Renaissance art.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b></center><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Mary Magdalene.</b>  What parts of thestory do you see in this painting?  <B>(A priest witnesses a host of angelslifting Mary up to heaven.)</B>  How can you tell it's a priest?  <B>(Ecclesiasticclothing.)</B>  How can you tell they are angels?  <B>(Wings.)</B>  How many angels arethere?  <B>(Fourteen.)</B><br><br>			<B>2.</B>	Attention to details is one of the most characteristic traits of German<a href="glossary.html#RENAISSANCE">RENAISSANCE</a> art.

They believed that artists should strive to representperfection even if that perfection was absent in real nature.  For example, thestory of Mary Magdalene tells us that hair grew over her entire body, butStr&uuml;b did not paint hair on Mary's knees and breasts.  Lack of hair onMary's knees suggests her kneeling in prayer, while lack of hair on Mary'sbreasts signifies her ideal feminine beauty.  How else has Str&uuml;b idealizedhis subject?  Clue:  The story of Mary Magdalene tells us she lived in a cavefor 30 years before angels daily lifted her toward heaven!  Does Mary look asif she lived in a cave for 30 years in this painting? Why not?<p><hr><BR><b>Think</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	During the Middle Ages, Mary Magdalene served as a reminder toCatholics that every one may be forgiven.
