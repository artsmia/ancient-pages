His friend called him a fool for believingeverything his mother told him.  Ashamed, Phaeton begged his mother for proofthat Helios was really his father. She suggested that he visit the sun godhimself for confirmation.<p>			Phaeton journeyed east to the sun god's grand royal palace. Helios welcomedhis son and, to prove their bond, promised young Phaeton any favor he wished.He did not anticipate that the headstrong boy would ask for permission to drivehis powerful chariot by himself for a day.  Bound by his promise, Helios had togive in.  Just before daybreak Phaeton donned his father's solar crown andstepped into the shining chariot. Sensing unfamiliar hands on the reins, thesun horses thundered off across the sky, veering far off their usual course.<p>			Unrestrained, the horses headed through the northern constellations.  Chaosensued.  Warmed by the sun for the first time ever, the small and great bearsbecame restless.  The usually placid serpent became threatening and the plowmanran away, even though he was not used to moving quickly, because of the weightof his plow.  The startled black scorpion prepared to sting Phaeton.<p>			Panicked, Phaeton let go of the reigns and the chariot careened haphazardlythrough the sky.  When it fell too close to the earth, scorching areas intodesert, the earth pleaded for help. Zeus (zoose) came to the earth's rescue,hurling a mighty lightning bolt, which shattered the chariot into many pieces.Phaeton tumbled to his death in a river.  Mourning for Phaeton, his sistersturned into poplar trees, from which their tears flowed and hardened into dropsof amber.  <p></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><br><ul><b>Phaeton</b><br>The Greek story of Phaeton was probably based on older talesthat explained eclipses or speculated about the disasters that would result if the sun ever veered from its regular pathacross the sky.  Despite many possibleinterpretations of Phaeton's story, it is most obviously a metaphor for thelimitless desires, but finite powers, of human beings.  The story wasfabulously elaborated upon by the Roman poet Ovid (AH-vid) in his collection ofstories called <i>Metamorphoses</i>.  During the Renaissance the story took onan entirely new significance.    <p><b>The Italian Renaissance</b><br>		During the 14th and 15th centuries, many Italian cities	became important European centers of industry and trade.Living conditions improved and people became more interested in their earthlyexistence than with life after death, a significant reversal of the attitudesof their medieval predecessors.  The term Renaissance, meaning "rebirth,"derives from this renewed interest in life on earth and a new confidence inhumankind's potential for achievement.  A revival of the art and literature ofthe ancient Greeks and Romans, which began in the 13th century, contributed tothe humanism of Renaissance Italy and greatly influenced its art.  Renaissanceart became increasing <a href="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</a> as artists studied their own world andclassical art.  <p>			In order to reconcile the classical past with Christian beliefs, Renaissancescholars looked for Christian morals in classical myths whose original meaningswere no longer understood.  For example, Phaeton's unsuccessful efforts wereequated with Lucifer's attempts to get too close to god.  Moralizers drew connections betweenPhaeton's demise and the Old Testament text of Isaiah 14:12 - "How art thoufallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning."  Scenes of Phaeton falling from his chariotwere thus very popular in Renaissance art. <p><b>Cassone</b><br>		This type of chest is usually referred to by its Italianname, <i>cassone</i>.  Cassoni (cass-OH-nee) were most often used as marriagechests to hold brides' household linens.  Especially popular from the 14th tothe 16th century, cassoni usually featured scenes from the classical mythologyso popular at this time.  This cassone exemplifies the Italian Renaissancestyle of art, particularly in its attention to the human body, the illusion ofrealistic spaces achieved through <a href="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE">PERSPECTIVE</a> techniques, and its adaptation ofclassical motifs.  <p><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/09a.gif" ALIGN=left hspace=8> This cassone tells the story of Phaeton in four carved panels. The firstvignette shows young Phaeton cavorting with the child who taunted him. Typicalof Renaissance figures, their bodies are turned and their knees are bent toconvey a sense of movement.  Their windblown drapery enhances the sense ofaction. Their pseudo-Greek garb and tightly curled hair evoke ancient Greeksculpture. The artist achieved a believable sense of depth by carving thefrontmost figure in deeper <a href="glossary.html#RELIEF">RELIEF</a>.<BR><br clear=left>In the second panel, Phaeton's mother points in the direction of the sun,represented as a stern human face with rays.  Phaeton eagerly reaches outtoward his father.  His partially nude body is babylike, reminiscent of Greekcarvings of Cupid. Again, action is achieved with billowing drapery.  Theartist creates the illusion of space by carving the doorway behind the figuresin low relief and by making the distant sun very small.<p><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/09b.gif" ALIGN=right hspace=8> The third scene shows Phaeton on his knees before his mighty father, who ishere represented as a man standing on a decorated platform.  The marvelouspalace of Helios recalls classical architecture.<p>The cassone's final panel shows the image of Phaeton most familiar duringthe Renaissance.  Phaeton, now represented fully nude and adult, tumbles fromthe chariot alongside two falling horses.  The anatomy of Phaeton and thehorses is remarkably well rendered.<BR><br clear=right>Many adaptations of classical motifs decorate this elaborate cassone.  Onthe corners are harpies - monsters with the heads and breasts of women and thewings and claws of birds - which were said to torment misers.  Harpiessymbolized the deadly sin of greed (avarice) in many Renaissance moralallegories.  The five heads punctuating the horizontal band above the mainscenes and the single large face at the center bottom of the chest arevariations on satyr and gorgon masks that often decorated classicalarchitecture.  One face conceals the key hole in its mouth.  Around these facesare anthemia, conventional floral motifs based on the honeysuckle or palmette.The leaves in the narrow band around the lid of the cassone are acanthus,another popular classical decoration.</ul><P><hr><a name=Questions></A><center><b>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b><br><B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Phaeton.</b>  <b>Show image 9 and explain that the cassone tells the story ofPhaeton in the four carved panels.</b> <b>Show image 9a and ask:</b>  What partof the story do you see carved in the first panel (left)? <B> (Phaeton is tauntedby his playmate.)
