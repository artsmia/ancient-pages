His first wife bore a thousand children who all decided to become monks and follow the Buddha's law. His second wife had only two sons. The youngest was named Non-o (NON-oh) and helped his monk brothers with their worship. The eldest, Kongorikishi, however, had a much more aggressive personality. He vowed to protect the Buddha and his worshipers by fighting against evil and ignorance. </ul><HR><a name="Background"></A><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER><UL><B>Nio </B><BR>Kongorikishi was the first of the heavenly kings, called Nio. The Nio were originally Hindu gods in India, who were adopted by the Japanese into the Buddhist pantheon. The Nio, also called Kongo, all came to be considered aggressive guardian deities in the tradition of Kongorikishi. Within the generally pacifist traditions of Buddhism, stories of Nio guardians like Kongorikishi justified the use of physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs against evil. <P><B>Samurai </B><BR>Widespread discontent with the dictatorship of the Taira (tie-RAH) clan in Kyoto (key-OH-toe) caused an enormous uprising in 1180. Five years of brutal civil war ensued, ending when the Minamoto clan overthrew the Taira. The Minamoto handed control of the new government to a group of loyal warriors, called samurai (SAM-oo-rye). The samurai unified their forces under a code known as the "way of the warrior" which valued bravery, honor, and strength. <P>In art, the luxurious tastes and refinement of the Kyoto nobility were replaced by the directness and simplicity of the samurai. The dynamic spirit of the age demanded art that was similarly big and brash. The civil war had severely damaged many temples, and artists set about rebuilding, restoring, and replacing lost sculptures. In many instances they emulated the <a href="glossary.html#IDEALIZED"> IDEALIZED</A> but <a href="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC"> NATURALISTIC</A> art made hundreds of years earlier during the Nara period (645-784). Among the many sculptures produced were pairs of large Nio guardian figures that stood outside Buddhist temple complexes. <P><B>Nio Guardian Figures </B><BR>These Nio guardian figures named Misshaku (mish-AH-koo) Kongo (congo)-with his fist raised-and Naeren (NAY-ren) Kongo (congo) represent the use of overt power and latent power, respectively. They display the energy and realism characteristic of late 14th-century Japanese sculpture.<P>Standing on banks of fluffy clouds, the guardians are enormously muscled half-nude figures. Their features have been skillfully exaggerated by an artist well versed in the human form. Bulging muscles in their huge chests and arms communicate power even at a great distance. This exaggerated <a href="glossary.html#REALISM"> REALISM</A> continues in the Nios' popping veins, extended jaws, and even in their delicate fingernails and toenails. The guardians' hair, pulled tightly into topknots, adds to their imposing height. <P>For all of their power, the Nio are also decorative. Their flower-shaped nipples and rippled rib cages form an elegant <a href="glossary.html# PATTERN"> PATTERN</A>. The dark and light areas on the sculptures are traces of <a href="glossary.html#GESSO">GESSO</A> and black <a href="glossary.html#LACQUER"> LACQUER</A> that once covered their surfaces. Flesh-colored pigments covered portions of the lacquer. <P>The Nio exhibit tremendous energy. Their arms, legs, and clublike feet dramatically jut into space, and drapery swirls violently around them. The Nio's bulging eyes, furrowed brows, flaring nostrils, and distorted grimaces bring their faces to life. <P>Conceived as a pair, the Nio complement each other. Misshaku Kongo, representing overt power, bares his teeth and raises his fist in action, while Naeren Kongo, representing latent might, holds his mouth tightly closed and waits with both arms tensed but lowered. <P>Each Nio figure represents a particular cosmic sound. Misshaku Kongo's open mouth sounds out "ah," meaning birth. Naeren Kongo sounds "om," meaning death. Thus, in one cosmic sound life is encapsulated at a temple doorway, reminding viewers that life is fleeting and that good karma is necessary to avoid rebirth on the Wheel of Life.</ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a><br><ul><b>LOOK</b><br><B>1. </B> <b>Tell the story of Kongorikishi.  </b>This story justified the use ofphysical force to defend the Buddha and his worshippers against evil.  How dothese guardian figures, part of the tradition of Kongorikishi, personifyphysical force?  Consider: size, musculature, body type, and pose.  <b>Thesefigures are over six feet tall, bulging muscles and stocky build suggeststrength, poses suggest energetic movement.</b><p><B>2.</B>  What are these figures standing on?  <b>Clouds.</b>  How can you tell?<b>Bases are carved in swirling mist-like patterns. </b> What does that tell usabout their domain?  <b>Heavenly domain rather than earthly.</b><p><B>3.</B>  Compare these two guardian figures.  What is the same about them? <b>Height, weight, musculature and body type, body decoration and jewelry,hairstyle, facial features, garments.  </b>What is different? <b> Poses orgestures, facial expressions.</b><p><B>4.</B>  One of the figures stands for latent power and the other stands for directaction. Which is which?  How can you tell?  <b>The figure with its fist raised,Misshaku Kongo, stands for direct action.  Raised fist, stiff right arm andopen mouth with bared teeth suggest that this figure is physically threatening.Explain  that Misshaku Kongo's mouth sounds out "ah", meaning birth.  Thefigure with its arms lowered, Naeren Kongo, stands for latent power.  Loweredbent arms close to the body and hand extended in a halting gesture, mouthclosed, suggest that this figure's power is contained, in control.  Explainthat Naeren Kongo's mouth sounds out "om", meaning death.</b><p><B>5.</B>  These Nio Guardian figures would have stood outside the entrance toa Buddhist temple. Look carefully at these figures standing side by side.  Isone made for the left side of an entrance and one made for the right?  Which iswhich?  How can you tell?  <b>Misshaku Kong, with raised fist, was meant forthe left side and Naeren Kongo, with arms lowered, was meant for the right.  Inthis configuration, Naeren Kongo's lowered arm fits neatly under MisshakuKongo's raised fist, their extended legs are mirror images of each other, theyface away from each other rather than toward each other and their garments flowoutward, away from the entrance that would have been between them.</b><p><B>6.</B>  In art, NATURALISTIC means representing something the way you wouldsee it in nature.  STYLIZED means representing something by distorting itsnatural forms to express an idea about it.  Where has the artist who carvedthese figures used naturalistic representation?  <b>Musculature on arms,abdomen, facial expression, drapery on clothing.</b> Where has he used stylizedrepresentation?  <b>Hair, ears, chest and rib cage, nipples, hands, feet.</b></ul><BR><HR><BR><ul><B>THINK</B><br><B>1.</B>  These wooden Nio Guardian figures were originally covered with blacklacquer.  Some traces of the lacquer still appear on the sculptures.  Wouldthey be more or less threatening if they still had their black coating?Explain.  <b>No right answer.</b><p><B>2.</B>  Nio Guardian figures served as symbolic protection at a Buddhisttemple hundreds of years ago.  What are symbols of protection that we seetoday?  <b>Operation Identification stickers on front doors, McGruff safe housesigns, bars on windows, traffic signs serve as protection for drivers.</b><p><B>3.</B>  These two guardian figures stood outside an entrance to a Buddhist temple.Buddhism is a nonviolent religion.  What message would these sculptures conveyto the Buddhist worshippers who pass between them? <b> Recall the story ofKongorikishi.  Rather than intimidate Buddhist worshippers the Nio Guardianfigures were meant to reassure them that they were protected against evilforces.</b><p><B>4.</B>  Each Nio figure represents a particular cosmic sound.  MisshakuKongo's open mouth sounds out "ah", meaning birth.  Naeren Kongo's mouth soundsout "om", meaning death. What purpose might these sounds serve at a Buddhisttemple entrance?  They encompass life, reminding worshippers that theirspiritual life is contained in the temple.<p></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide23.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide23.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide23.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><!--------Bottom Main Menu------><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
