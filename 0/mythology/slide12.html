He wanted to marry Danae, but wanted nothing todo with her adult son, Perseus. Hoping to get rid of Perseus, Polydectesruthlessly tricked the young man into brashly undertaking a deadly mission - tobring him the head of a dreaded monster called Medusa.<p>			Medusa was one of three fearsome Gorgon sisters who lived far away in asecret hiding place.  The sisters had brass claws, golden wings, boars' tusks,and masses of hissing snakes for hair.  Anyone who looked into their frightfulfaces instantly turned into stone.  <p>			Fortunately, the gods Athena (a-THEE-na) and Hermes (HER-meez), and threenymphs offered to help Perseus.  Athena gave him a shiny bronze shield andHermes gave him a sword that could not be bent by the Gorgons' scales.  Thenymphs gave Perseus winged shoes so that he could fly, a cap that made himinvisible, and a pouch in which to carry the Gorgon's head.  <p>			Perseus flew first to the home of the aged ones.  These three women, whowere sisters to the Gorgons, were born with gray hair and shared a single eyeand tooth between them.  Wearing his cap of invisibility, Perseus snatched theeye as one sister passed it to another.  Threatening to keep the eye, Perseuscoerced them into revealing the Gorgon's secret hiding place.<p>			Perseus arrived at the cave of the Gorgons, where, by good fortune, theywere all asleep.  In order to see Medusa without turning to stone, Perseuslocated her grotesque face in a reflection on his shiny shield.  He swiftly cutoff her head, dropped it into his bag, and fled from Medusa's angry sisters.When Perseus returned to Seriphos, the evil Polydectes laughed at him and askedwhat was in his sack.  Perseus pulled out the horrifying head of Medusa andturned Polydectes to stone.   <p>			You see, Medusa's severed head retained its power to turn people into stone,so Perseus carried it on many adventures, using it to defeat his enemies.Eventually, in gratitude for her protection, Perseus gave Medusa's head toAthena, who placed it on her breastplate to ward off evil.  <p></ul><hr><a name="Background"></A><center><b>Background</b></center><br>	<ul><b>Medusa</b><br> 		Perseus's story is one of many Greek monster-slayer myths that features the theme of good outwitting evil.  Since at least the 6th century B.C., Greeks placed images of Medusa'sterrifying head on shields and buildings in order to frighten away enemies andevil spirits.<p>			According to 4th-century B.C. revisions of her story, Medusa was a beautifulwoman who was turned into a monster by jealous Athena.  At the turn of the 19thto the 20th century, writers and artists popularized the image of Medusa as abeautiful young woman.<p><b>French Sculpture</b><br>		No single style dominated French sculpture at the turn of the century.  Sculptors worked in <a href="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</a>,expressionistic, and <a href="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</a> symbolic styles.  In response to the popularappeal of the consciously decorative Art Nouveau style, many artistsincorporated its organic forms and long, sinuous curves into their art.   <p><b>Emile-Antoine Bourdelle</b><br>		Emile-Antoine Bourdelle (ay-MEEL an-TWAN boor-DELL) was an eclectic sculptor who drew upon a number of thediverse trends of his time, including elements of Art Nouveau.  Hedrew most heavily upon the organic qualities of French Romanesque and Gothiccathedral sculpture and the simple forms of archaic Greek sculpture.  Motivatedby his conviction that history's greatest sculptures were those integrated witharchitecture, Bourdelle created many of his sculptures for architecturalsettings.<p><b>Door Knocker in Form of Medusa</b><br>	In this bronze door knocker, Bourdelle depicts thesevered head of Medusa, hanging from Perseus's clenched fist.Above his hand a bunch of snakes writhe, striking out as if theyare going to attack.  Below, only a few of Medusa's many braids actually looklike scaly snakes. <p>			As was popular at the turn of the century, Bourdelle represents Medusa as abeautiful young woman rather than the horrible monster of the original story.Her facial features - high cheekbones, narrow nose, square chin, and the cornersof her small mouth - consciously recall the expressively modeled faces ofarchaic Greek sculptures of young women.  The dominant curves of her hair,however, reflect the popular Art Nouveau style.<p>			Bourdelle's clever transformation of Medusa into an ornamental door knockerattests to his commitment to integrating sculpture and architecture.  Twoentwined braids extend from ear to ear to create the knocker's handle.  Whenlifted back and forth, Medusa's head would knock against the circular formbehind it. Bourdelle produced ten casts of this door knocker, an indicationthat he designed it for a general market rather than for a specific door.   </ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><b>Look</b><br>			<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Perseus and Medusa. </b> Where do you seePerseus in this bronze sculpture?  <B>(The hand holding the head of Medusa isPerseus's hand.) </B> Where do you see snakes?  <B>(Medusa's hair, above Perseus'shand.)</B> According to the story, what would happen if you saw this scene in reallife?  <B>(You would turn to stone!)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>	This bronze sculpture had a special purpose.

Do you think the faceof Medusa in Bourdelle's sculpture is ugly?  Explain.  <b>Discuss the4th-century B.C. revisions of the story that cast Medusa as a beautiful youngwoman.  Bourdelle's sculpture of Medusa's face recalls archaic Greeksculpture.</b><p>			<B>4.</B>	When Bourdelle made this door knocker, Art Nouveau was a popular <a href="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</a>.Sculpture created in the Art Nouveau style is characterized by long elegantcurves.

Bourdelle made Medusa's head into a door knocker.  Why do you thinkMedusa was a popular image for buildings?  <b>Recall how Perseus and thenAthena used Medusa's head to protect them from their enemies.</b>  <B>(Medusaprovided protection for the inhabitants of buildings, much as she providedprotection for Perseus and Athena.)</B>  Athena appears on the <a href="slide7.html">Greek hydria in image 7</a>.

Describe thekind of door you might hang it on. A bathroom door?  A broom closet door?  Whyor why not?  How big would a door have to be to accommodate this door knocker?<B>(Very large - even the front door of an average family home would be too smallto accommodate it.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Bourdelle believed that history's greatest sculptures were thoseintegrated with architecture.  His transformation of Medusa into an ornamentaldoor knocker illustrates his conviction.  Where have you seen examples ofsculpture integrated with architecture in your neighborhood?  In places youhave visited?  Describe them.<p><B>4.</B>	 The story of Perseus and Medusa is one of many Greekmonster-slayer myths celebrating the victory of good over evil.   Can you thinkof any stories popular today in which an evil monster is conquered?  <B>(Batman,the Ghostbusters, and Alien movies, Rumpelstiltskin, Dracula,Frankenstein.)</B><br></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide12.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide12.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide12.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><!--------Bottom Main Menu------><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
