Simply by speaking the name ofsomething, Re created it.  As he namedbirds, animals, and things, they appeared.  Because Re made all things, he alsocontrolled them.  More powerful than anyone, he ruled both heaven and earth.<p><p>			Isis, a clever god gifted in the arts of magic, envied Re's power.  Shedesired to know Re's secret Great Name, because it was the key to his magic andwould give her greater power. Isis spent a lot of time wondering how she couldobtain Re's secret.  As Re grew older and weaker, she devised a plot. <p><p>			Whenever Re drooled, the wily Isis gathered up his spit. Kneading the spitwith soil, she created a serpent.  Although the serpent came forth from Re, hehad not created it, so it was outside of his control.  Isis molded the serpentinto the form of a dart and placed it on Re's daily walking path across thesky. When Re passed by, the serpent reared up and stung him.<p><p>			Soon, Re began to burn with the serpent's venom.  He was baffled by thecreature's behavior and dismayed to discover that he had no power over it.  Hecould not cure his body of the terrible pain.  Re called to his children forhelp, but they could not end his suffering.<p><p>			Then Isis came forth and offered to work her magic to end Re's pain.However, she insisted she could cure Re only if he revealed his secret GreatName.  Re offered a variety of nicknames, but clever Isis was not fooled.Fearing for his life, Re finally gave in and transmitted the Great Name fromhis heart to Isis's.  That is how Isis successfully learned the secret of Re'sall-powerful magic.<p><p></ul><hr> <center><a name=Background></A><b>Background</b></center>	<ul><b>Isis</b><BR>According to a rich mythology surrounding the Egyptiangoddess, Isis raised her husband, Osiris (oh-SIGH-rus), from the dead, protected her son, Horus (HOR-us), from a variety ofcertain deaths, and knew the secrets of immortality.  She was faithful,intelligent, strong, and beautiful.  Like Osiris, Isis was associated withvegetation and the cycles of the seasons and the Nile River.  Ancient beliefsattributed the annual rainfall, which sustained the people of the Nile Valley,to the tears Isis shed for Osiris.<br><br><b>Romans in Egypt</b><br>In the 1st century B.C., Egypt became a province of Rome under the leadership of Augustus.  The Romans ruthlesslyexacted money and resources from Egypt.  The Roman rulers thrived at greatexpense to the conquered Egyptians.  Over the centuries of Roman domination,people in Egypt and throughout the Mediterranean world sought hope and comfortthrough the worship of the traditional Egyptian gods whose mythology embraced acentral belief in life after death--Osiris, Isis, and their son, Horus.    <p><p><b>Figures</b><br>		In Egypt, people regularly left small bronze figures of deitiesat temples or funereal sites in order to attract the deity represented. Byoffering a sculpture at a temple, one could pay homage to a god and hope togain his or her favor and protection.  <p><B>Statuette of Isis</B><br>This statuette of Isis dates to the 1st centuryA.D.,  when Rome ruled over Egypt; the artistic traditionsof both cultures are evident in its design.  Traditional<a href="glossary.html#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTES</a> identify Isis--her crown, serpent, <a href="glossary.html#AMULET">AMULET</a>, and jug.  Her stiffstance is characteristically Egyptian.  The sculpture's naturalism, however, ischaracteristic of Roman Imperial art; Isis's large eyes, broad upper lip, androunded cheeks all give her face a portrait quality.  Much of her gown isclose-fitting, revealing the solidly rounded form of her breasts, stomach, andthighs.  Her gown falls loosely over her legs in graceful and realisticallyfluid folds. <p><p>					Several aspects of the sculpture are symbolic attributes of Isis'sidentity and power.  In her left hand Isis holds her magical dart-shapedserpent, a reference to the power gained from her knowledge of Re's secretname.  In her right hand is a jug,presumably of sacred water, associated with accomplished magicians.  Over afabulous wig of cascading curls, Isis wears the combined crown of Upper andLower Egypt, indicating her dominion over both.  At the base of her crown avulture wraps its wings around her head, symbolizing her protective powers.  Ather bust is a Tyt (tit) amulet, also known as an Isis-knot, a fertility <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</a>and a reference to her life-giving powers.<p><p></ul><hr><center><a name=Questions></A><B>Discussion Questions</B></center> <br><ul><b>Look</b>	<br><B>1.</B>  This statuette includes two important features from the story of Isis.What are they?  <B>(Isis and the serpent.)</B>  Does the serpent look different fromother snakes you have seen?

Name the stylistic differences between Osiris and Isis.  Consider:facial features, treatment of bodies and garments, and media.  (Osiris's face,shown in profile, is consistent with Egyptian formulas for representing people.Isis has natural features more consistent with portraiture and meant to be seenfrom many sides.  Isis's body is a <a href="glossary.html#THREE-DIMENSIONAL">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</a> sculpture with roundedforms, Osiris's body is a <a href="glossary.html#TWO-DIMENSIONAL">TWO-DIMENSIONAL</a> painting with flat, straight outlinesand angles.
