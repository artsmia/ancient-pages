He let   his wife-sister, Isis (EYE-sus), rule Egypt for a short time while   he traveled the world to spread law and order and to teach people   farming skills. His brother, Seth, became jealous of Osiris's   popularity and power. So, upon Osiris's return, Seth murdered him,   put his body in an elaborate cedar coffin, and cast it into the   Nile River.      <P>The coffin washed ashore at Byblos (BIB-lus) in Lebanon, where   a tamarisk tree arose and encased it. Impressed by the tree's   tremendous size, the king of Byblos had it cut down and placed as   a pillar in his main hall. Isis searched for her husband's body   and eventually located it in the pillar in the king's hall. She   then won permission to bring his remains back to Egypt. Seth,   furious that his brother's remains had been retrieved, cut   Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them throughout the land.   </P>      <P>Isis set out again to find her husband, a much more difficult   task this time. Wherever she found a part of his body, she created   a wax duplicate of the part; she presented the wax part to the   local priest and demanded that it be placed in a temple and   worshiped, so that her husband's memory would be preserved.</P>   <P>When nearly all the body parts were gathered, Isis used her own   great magic, and the help of several other gods, to put Osiris   back together. They preserved his body and wrapped it in linen   bandages, creating the first mummy and establishing the funereal   ritual for all subsequent burials of important people. Magically,   Isis breathed life back into Osiris and the god-king rose from the   dead. But instead of living on earth, Osiris chose to rule in the   Underworld. He left earthly rule up to his son, Horus (HOR-us).   </P></UL><P><HR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B></P><UL>   The Osiris myth has grown and changed over time. Osiris was first   worshiped only as a god of vegetation because his life cycle -   birth, death, and rebirth - paralleled the growth cycle of the   crops on which Egyptians depended. He was later associated with   other natural cycles that ordered the Egyptian world, including   the flooding of the Nile and the rising and setting of the sun.   Many Egyptians came to consider him a one-time earthly ruler, or   pharaoh (FAIR-oh), and some viewed him as god of the moon. But it   was his association with strong family ties and eternal life that   made him one of the most widely worshiped gods.    <P>Initially, Osiris was worshiped mainly by the pharaohs and   their royal families because only they, considered descendants of   the gods, were entitled to the privilege of eternal life. However,   by the 18th Dynasty (1551-1310 B.C.), everyone who worshiped   Osiris was promised the possibility of life after death.</P>      <P>As god of the Underworld, Osiris appeared regularly on funereal   objects, including mummy coffins and cases. His presence assured   that the dead man or woman would, like Osiris, rise and live   again.<BR>      <BR>   <B>Mummification</B><BR>      Because the Egyptians believed that each person possessed a   <I>ka</I> (kah), a double that lived on in the Afterworld, they   preserved the dead through a complex system of embalming and   mummification. The prepared bodies were often enclosed in cases   like this one, made of plastered, painted, and varnished linen and   were then placed in decorated coffins. They preserved the body   because the <I>ka</I> could live on only if it had a place to   reside (a body or a <I>ka</I> statue, for example). Many   standardized images covered the cases and coffins to assist the   <I>ka</I> in its passage to the Afterworld.</P>   <P>This mummy case encloses the remains of Lady Teshat (TEH-shet),   a fifteen-year-old girl. Because her father was closely associated   with the pharaoh, she received an elaborate burial.</P>      <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/01a.gif" WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=left HSPACE=8><B>Detail of Osiris</B><BR>      Symbolic pictures of Osiris appear in several places on Lady   Teshat's mummy case. Each image embodies   <A HREF="glossary.html#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTES</A> that identify the   god. In this painting from the right shoulder he is depicted as an   enthroned king, reinforcing his role as ruler of the dead. (See   detail.) He holds a shepherd's crook and whip,   <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</A> of his authority. He   wears the red crown of Lower Egypt decorated with a curly ostrich   plume, to signify his earthly life and reign. His ritual straight   false beard is like those worn by Egyptian pharaohs to indicate   their godly status. The green color of Osiris's skin, associated   with vegetation, symbolizes life after death.</P>      <P>Osiris is tightly wrapped like a mummy in an orange-red   garment, an indication that he lived on after death through   mummification. His stiff pose is also due in part to the   <A HREF="glossary.html#FORMULAIC">FORMULAIC</A> standard Egyptians   used to show the human body; they regularly depicted the most   characteristic aspects of a figure. The head, legs, and feet are   shown in profile, while the eye and shoulder are represented as   though seen from the front.<BR>      At the base of the throne is a stacked form, which might be a djed   (jed) pillar. The djed pillar represents Osiris's backbone   (certainly an appropriate image for a mummy case), recovered by   Isis; to the Egyptians it symbolized stability and continuity.   </P></UL><P><HR></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion Questions</FONT></B></P><UL>   <B>Look</B><BR>   <B>1.</B> Osiris was the first Egyptian to be mummified.

Therefore,   a nonbeliever cannot possibly understand or experience the music,   the paintings, the poetry, or any artform created by believers.   </P>   <P>Is the theologian right about what nonbelievers can understand   of religious art? Do we have to believe in Osiris as a god and pay   homage to him in order to understand and appreciate this painting?   <B>(No right answer.)</B></P></UL><P><!--------Bottom Myth Menu------></P><P><HR><TABLE BORDER=3 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD>         <P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</A> ~         <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html         ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html">Your         Comments Wanted</A> ~ <A HREF="#Story">Story</A> ~         <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~         <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</A>      </TD></TR></TABLE><HR><CENTER><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~<A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~<A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~<A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></BODY></HTML>
