Here lived six beings:  First Man, First Woman, Salt Woman, FireGod, Coyote, and Begochiddy, the golden-haired child of the Sun.  Begochiddymade four mountains in this first world - white to the east; blue to the south;yellow to the west; and black to the north.  Then Begochiddy made insects andplants.  But conflicts arose and the first beings, tired of the First World andits darkness, decided to leave.  <p>			At the center of the First World, Begochiddy made a red mountain and planteda giant reed.  The first beings gathered all of Begochiddy's creations andcrawled inside of the hollow reed.  The reed grew and grew and carried theminto the Second World.  In the Second World, which was blue, Begochiddy createdstill more new things.  When the Cat People, who lived in the Second World,fought the newcomers, First Man used magic to overcome them.  Conflicts againdisrupted the harmony of this world and the first beings collected theirpossessions and travelled in the giant reed up to the Third World.<p>			The Third World was beautiful, yellow and filled with light. There,Begochiddy created rivers and springs, animals and birds, trees and lightning,and many kinds of human beings. When the men and women began to quarrel,Begochiddy separated them.  But they were so unhappy that Begochiddy reunitedthem, warning that the Third World would be flooded if there was any moretrouble.<p>			And then Coyote caused trouble.  Walking by the river, he spied in the watera baby with long black hair.  He lifted the baby from the river and hid itunder his blanket, telling no one. Colorful storms and torrential rainsapproached from all directions.  Everyone fled to the protective hollow of thegiant reed, which carried them upward.  But the reed stopped growing before itreached the next world.  So Locust helped Begochiddy make a hole that led tothe Fourth World, an island surrounded by water.  <p>			Seeing the waters still rising in the Third World, Begochiddy asked who hadangered the Water Monster.  Coyote tightened his blanket about his body andBegochiddy ordered him to open it.  There was the water baby.  Coyote returnedthe baby to the Third World and the waters receded.  In the Fourth World,Begochiddy set out the mountains and placed the moon, sun, and stars in thesky.  Begochiddy taught everyone the right way to live, including how to carefor plants such as corn, squash, and beans, and how to give thanks.<p></ul><hr><a name="Background"><center><b>Background</b></a></center><br><ul><b>The Navajo</b><br> 			The Navajo call themselves Dine (DEE-nay), meaning "the people."  They migrated from northwestern Canada sometime around 1400 to what is now the southwest region of theUnited States.  The early Navajo were nomadic hunters.  They learned farmingand weaving from the native Pueblo peoples, with whom they also developed tradenetworks.<p>			Since the 16th century, various peoples, including the Spanish, Mexicans,and Euro-Americans, tried to control the Navajo. But their sophisticated nativeculture remained strong.  The United States Army began an aggressive campaignagainst the Navajo in 1863, destroying their livestock and crops.  Many Navajowere then forced onto government reservations. <p><b>Silver</b><br>			While on the reservation, many Navajo artists created silverjewelry and textiles for trade.  When white traders opened trading posts on thereservations, a barter system developed, enabling the Navajo to exchange theirhandmade products for tools, canned foods, and other manufactured products.Silver jewelry was a particularly valuable trade item, especially by the turnof the century, when railroad expansion brought a flourishing tourist market tothe Southwest.  Commercial jewelry businesses coerced Navajo artists tomass-produce nontraditional objects such as boxes, letter openers, andashtrays.  However, silversmiths who livedoutside of large trade centers continued to produce more traditional art forms,including bracelets, buckles, and ketohs.<p><b>Ketohs</b><br>		Ketohs were originally leather straps worn by Navajo archers toprotect their forearms from the snap of the bowstring when shooting an arrow.By the 1870s, silver was commonly attached to the leather to give the wearermore protection.  The designs of the silver ketohs gradually became moreintricate as they evolved into the purely decorative form of jewelry they aretoday.  In the reservation barter system, a ketoh could be traded for severalsheep. <p><b>Ketoh</b><br>		This ketoh features an open-worked rectangle of silverattached to a dark brown leather strap.  An oval of <a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> turquoise marks thecenter of the piece.  Broad curves of silver, like pairs of leaves around acentral bud, extend to the four corners of the design.  Single corn stalksemerge from the top and bottom of the turquoise.<p>			Ketoh designs often have an emphatic center like this one, recalling thesacred place from which the first Navajo emerged from the giant reed into thisworld.  The symmetrical four-part organization seen here is also commonly usedto evoke the four cardinal directions.  In the Navajo creation story,Begochiddy brought order out of chaos by dividing the fourth and final worldinto four quadrants, marking each with a mountain. Order and harmony arefurther evoked in the ketoh through the careful balance of curved lines,symbolizing the female ideal of activity, and straight lines, symbolizing themale ideal of stasis.<p><b>H&oacutezh&oacute</b><br>		The Navajo ideals of order, balance, andharmony are encompassed in the concept of h&oacutezh&oacute, whichroughly means "beauty."  To the Navajo, a person is beautiful if his or herlife is in balance.  H&oacutezh&oacute guides all aspects of traditionalNavajo life, from agriculture to architecture to medicine.  H&oacutezh&oacuteis represented in art through balanced, symmetrical, centralized designs likethat of this ketoh.</ul><p><hr><center><b><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a> <br><ul><b>Look</b><br>			<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the Navajo creation story. </b> The design oftraditional Navajo ketohs recalls this creation story. When the six beings roseinto each of the four worlds, they always emerged at the center.  How has theartist marked the center of this ketoh?   <B>(With an <a href="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> turquoise oval.)</B>  Inthe story, Begochiddy brought order out of chaos in the Fourth World bydividing it into four quadrants, marking each with a mountain.

Why do you think this artist put corn stalks on theketoh?  <B>(Corn was an important source of food for the Navajo.  It remains animportant part of Navajo life today.)</B><p>			<B>4.</B>	<a href="glossary.html#SYMMETRY">SYMMETRICAL</a> balance is an exact balanced arrangement of forms on bothsides of an imaginary line through the center of an object.  <a href="glossary.html#ASYMMETRY">ASYMMETRICAL</A>balance is an arrangement of forms that do not appear the same on both sides ofthe imaginary center line.

The designs of the ketohs became more intricate as they evolvedinto the purely decorative form of jewelry they are today.

It is an exactbalanced arrangement of forms on both sides of an imaginary line through itscenter.  Look around your classroom.
