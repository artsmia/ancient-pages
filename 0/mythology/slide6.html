He magically transformed weeds into millet and cornand taught people to do the same.  He also taught them the value of hard work.Thanks to Chi Wara, the people became excellent and prosperous farmers.<p>			When crops were plentiful the people forgot about the lessons of the farminganimal and became less conscientious about their farming.  Chi Wara,disheartened, buried himself in the earth. Then the people began to havedifficulties with their crops. When they realized that Chi Wara was gone, theywere sorry they had taken him for granted.  They created a small mound in whichhis spirit could reside forever.  They also created dance headdresses in theform of the farming animal, to honor him and to remind themselves of thevirtues he had taught.<br></ul><hr><center><a name=Background></A><b>Background</b></center><br><ul>	<b>The Bamana</b><br> 	Most Bamana communities rely on farming for their survival.Living in west central Mali in Africa, Bamana farmers must struggle to produce crops from the poor soil of the drysavanna land.  Traditional Bamana religious beliefs and ritual glorifyagriculture and honor successful farmers.<p>			The ideal Bamana farmer works the land from sunrise to sunset, neverstraying from his task.  He hoes with pride, perseverance, and joy.  His fieldsare always free of weeds, and his harvests are always of the highest quality.This ideal farmer, therefore, must be strong in body and spirit, conscientious,and determined.  While few can achieve this ideal, those who do or who comeclose are called Chi Wara.  <i>Chi Wara</i> translates as "farming animal" andis understood in most Bamana villages to mean "excellent farmer."  <p><b>Chi Wara Performance</b><br>		At planting time, many young Bamana farmers compete in a hoeing contest.  Friends and relatives cheer them on andmasked male dancers wearing elegantly carved Chi Wara headdresses in the formof antelopes perform to honor and encourage them. Chi Wara, though not anantelope, has come to be associated with this elegant animal whose grace andstrength are held up as desirable qualities for champion farmers.  Theantelope's prolific reproduction rate also associates it with fertility andsuccessful growth. <p>			Chi Wara performers dance in pairs, representing the male and femaleantelope.  The male is associated with the sun, and the female, almost alwaysshown with a baby on her back, the earth.  Together they symbolize thenecessity of cooperation between the sun and earth and men and women to thesurvival of the Bamana.  Their fiber costumes represent the equally essentialwater.  <p>			Bent over and leaning on two short sticks of sunsun wood as forelegs, theChi Wara dancers move to the powerful rhythms of drums and women's songs ofpraise for the farmers.  Inviting the hoers to mimic them, the dancers bendtheir heads like antelopes, as if to break the earth with their horns.  Themale's dance is the more athletic, incorporating leaps and passages of fastrunning.  The male makes screeching noises, while the female is silent. <p>			As the Bamana respond to the influence of other cultures, especially thegrowing popularity of Islam, many of their own traditions have become diluted.The men's associations that once maintained social control and oversaw villagemasquerades are losing their significance.  As a result, many masquerades haveceased altogether.  The annual ceremonies to honor Chi Wara are practiced onlyrarely today, and few Bamana know the entire legend of Chi Wara.<p><b>Antelope Headdress</b><br>		This Chi Wara headdress, sculpted by an artist of thewestern 	Bamana, represents a male antelope with long sweepinghorns and neck.   The exaggerated horns, nearly twice the length of his body,dominate the figure.  On each side, the animal's long ear continues thesweeping line of these horns.  The prominent ears stress the value of hearingto the Bamana; when a man hears of ancestral accomplishments, he is encouragedto aspire to the same legendary virtues.  The figure has almond-shaped eyes and a short mane.  Its head rests on top of along collared neck, which extends from its small body.<p>			The animal's back is slightly curved and its tail is tightly curled. Itshind and front legs are bent, perhaps in anticipation of a leap.  The longcurving lines of his head, horns, and body and the spaces created by his bentlegs and curly tail form a graceful silhouette.  <a href="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERNS </a>of lines animate thefigure: curving diagonal lines wrapping around Chi Wara's horns, smaller linesrun down his head and back, a band of crisscrosses decorates his face, and arow of three triangles lines his snout.<p>			The wooden form of Chi Wara is attached to a basketlike cap made fromrattan, cotton, and leather.</ul><p><hr><center><a name=Questions></A><b>Discussion Questions</b></center><br>		<ul><b>Look</b><br>		<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the story of Chi Wara.</b>  Look carefully at theheaddress made by a Bamana artist to represent Chi Wara.  What kind of animalis Chi Wara?  Remember that the Bamana people live in the country of Mali onthe continent of Africa, so it has to be an animal familiar to them.<B>(Antelope. You may want to display a picture of an antelope for students tocompare with the headdress.)</B>  How can you tell?  <B>(Horns, small tail, legsand body are like those of a deer or antelope; head is shaped like a deer orantelope.)</B>  Is this how you pictured Chi Wara as you listened to the story?Explain.<br><br>			<B>2.</B>	Where do you see straight lines in this sculpture?  <B>(Bent legs aremade up of straight lines and angles; straight lines are incised on theanimal's snout, head, and back.)</B> Where do you see curved lines?  <B>(Curved linesmake up the animal's head, neck, horns, body, and tail.  Curved lines areincised on the horns and body.) </B> Which lines are more important in thisheaddress, curved or straight?  <B>(Curved.)</B> <b> </b>What effect do allthese long curves have on the overall feeling of the sculpture?  <B>(Curved linesgive the sculpture a graceful, flowing, elegant feeling.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	<a href="glossary.html#POSITIVE">POSITIVE SHAPES</a> occupy space, just like you do.  The spaces aroundpositive shapes are called <a href="glossary.html#NEGATIVE">NEGATIVE SHAPES</a>.  Where are the negative shapes inthis headdress?  <B>(The area between the legs, the large area between the top ofthe body and the animal's horns, and the area created by the curly tail.)</B>  Areany of them completely enclosed by positive shapes?  Are there equal amounts of positiveand negative shapes? <B>(Yes.)</B>  How do the amounts of positive and negative shapesaffect the balance of the sculpture? <B>(An equal distribution of positive andnegative shapes makes the sculpture appear balanced.)</B><p>			4.	An artist who makes <a href="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</a> sculpture tries to make an object appearas it would if you saw the real thing in nature.  An artist who makes <a href="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</a>sculpture exaggerates certain features and details, while leaving other detailsout of the sculpture.  Do you think this animal looks naturalistic or abstract?<B>(Abstract.)</B> Which features did the artist exaggerate?  <B>(Horns, ears, and headare large in contrast to the small body.  Neck is very long and large comparedto the rest of the body. The snout is elongated.  The curve of the animal'sback is exaggerated.  Legs are extremely bent.)</B><p><hr><b>Think</b><br><B>1.</B>	Did the artist who made this Chi Wara headdress represent thestory of Chi Wara or the character Chi Wara?  <B>(The character Chi Wara.)</B>  Thinkabout how this headdress is used.  Does the hoeing contest dance recall thewhole Chi Wara story or parts of the story?  <B>(Parts of the story.)</B>  Whichparts?  <B>(Dancers imitate movements of the antelope and bend their heads as ifthey were antelopes breaking the earth with their horns, recalling Chi Wara'slessons on farming.)</B><p>			<B>2.</B>  What qualities or features does an antelope possess that wouldalso be useful for a farmer?  <B>(Grace and physical strength.  The long horns ofthe antelope can be compared to farm tools with long handles such as the hoe.The antelope's ability to reproduce frequently can be associated withsuccessful crops.)</B><p>			<B>3.</B>	Why might dancers wear Chi Wara headdresses like this one to encourageBamana farmers to work hard to produce successful crops?  <B>(Headdresses honorChi Wara, reminding Bamana people of how Chi Wara taught farmers to beprosperous.  Dancers remind the farmers that the antelope's strength andreproduction are qualities that can help them be successful farmers.)</B><p>			4.	This headdress is an example of sculptural art made for a specificoccasion.  Can you think of things you see around you that are designed byartists for a specific occasion?  <B>(Jewelry such as wedding rings; hats forspecial occasions, such as yarmulkes and Easter bonnets; Christmas ornamentsand decorations; the list is endless!)</B><p></ul><!--------Bottom Myth Menu------><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide6.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide6.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide6.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><!--------Bottom Main Menu------><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
