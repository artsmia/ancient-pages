The people wondered and   argued about something they had heard of but never seen -   daylight. Some said that the river chief kept daylight in a   special box.   <P>Raven lived in the dark world. He was sly, wise, greedy, and   meddlesome. And he could change his form to suit his own needs.   Raven decided to find out about daylight, so he turned into a   hemlock needle and dropped into a freshwater spring. When the   river chief's daughter came to the spring to drink, Raven floated   into her cup, and she swallowed him. In due time, Raven was born   as the grandson of the river chief.</P>   <P>Raven grew very fast and his grandfather adored him, even   though he threw tantrums and his eyes looked a little like a   raven's. When he screamed, his doting grandfather let him play   with the Moon Box. He opened the box and the moon escaped into the   sky. When Raven wailed again, his grandfather let him play with   the Box of Daylight. As soon as the box was in his possession,   Raven changed back into a bird and flew through the smoke hole and   disappeared into the darkness.</P>   <P>Raven brought the box to the people and opened it slightly,   allowing a few streaks of daylight to escape. But they did not   believe he actually had daylight. Angered by the people's   skepticism, he threw open the box and flooded the world with the   bright light of day.</P></UL><HR><A NAME="Background"></A><CENTER><B>Background</B></center><UL>   <B>The Haida</B><BR>   Originally, the Haida lived on the Queen Charlotte Islands off the   coast of present-day British Columbia. In the early 1700s some of   them settled in the southern part of Prince of Wales Island, now   part of Alaska. The Haida were fishers who depended largely on   halibut and cod for their livelihood.   <P>During the 18th century, Europeans arrived on the Pacific Coast   and established fur-trading posts. Soon, Episcopal and Methodist   missionaries arrived to convert the Indians. Their conversion to   Christianity undermined traditional Haida culture, and disease and   alcohol brought by the outsiders decimated the population. Today,   small groups of Haida Indians live in the Masset and Skidgate   communities in Canada and at Hydaburg on Prince of Wales Island in   Alaska.</P>   <P><B>Raven</B><BR>   Raven is one of the most popular characters in Haida mythology. He   is said to have created the earth when he tired of flying over a   world covered with water. Landforms, tides, the habits of certain   animals - all those and more are credited to Raven. In many of the   stories, such as the story of daylight, the trickster Raven   changes his form.</P>   <P><B>Raven Rattles</B><BR>   The Haida have long been gif ted woodworkers. The men built great   houses and the most prized maritime boats along the coast. Haida   artists carved totem poles, storage boxes, utensils, and rattles   in the form of ravens, among other art objects.</P>   <P>Raven rattles take their name from their ravenlike shape.   Today, their original purpose and the exact meaning of their   complex decoration is no longer known. The first raven rattles may   have been powerful instruments used by religious specialists   called shamans. Twentieth-century Haida, however, say the rattles   were the instruments of dancing chiefs, part of the elaborate   <A HREF="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</A> they wore for a dance   to greet canoes from other villages. With his knees slightly bent   and his legs spread, the chief jumped on both feet to the time of   a rhythmic song beat, vibrating the rattle while dancing. Raven   rattles are now used only for special occasions.</P>   <P><B>Chief's Rattle</B> </P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/18a.gif" WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=left hspace=8>    <P>Raven's head thrusts upward and his chest puffs out, forming   the body of the rattle. His wings sweep downward along his sides.   The repeated vertical lines of Raven's beak, mouth, and his   diamond-shaped eye emphasize the proud upward thrust of his head.   <A HREF="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</a> shell forms his shiny opalescent eye.  Most known raven   rattles look much like this one, but they have the additional detail of a small   box of daylight held in his beak.   <p>   			Several birds are evident in this wooden rattle.  On Raven's belly is the   face of a rather large bird, carved in low <a href="   glossary.html #relief">RELIEF</A>. The design, barely visible here,   may depict a hawk or some other natural being. Another abstracted   bird's head faces the rattle handle.</P>  <P>A reclining man rests his head on Raven's head. His long red   arms wrap around his drawn-up knees. A long-billed bird bites the   man's extended tongue. The meaning of this exchange is unknown,   but may suggest the transference of power from one being to the   other.</P><P>The complex linear design of this rattle is characteristic of   Northwest Coast Indian art. Each form is tightly integrated into   the puzzlelike composition. Strong contour lines define many of   the forms, such as the brow, eye, nostril, and beak of Raven.   These lines tie the complex imagery together, leading from one   form to another to create a rhythmic composition.</P>   <P>The raven rattle was painted with black and bright colors that   also structured the design. Over time, much of this pigment has   worn away. However, traces of red paint are still visible on the   reclining man's arms and on the mouth, cheek, and forehead of the   large bird that is also Raven's chest.</P></UL><HR><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion Questions</B><UL>   <B>Look</B><BR>   <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Raven.</B> Where do you see the   Raven on this sculpture?

Can you find them?   Where is the human form on the sculpture?   <P><B>2.</B> This wooden rattle carved in the image of Raven is   used by a chief of the Haida people during ceremonies. How would   the chief hold the rattle? Is there a handle? Where?</P>   <P><B>3.</B> Did the artist who carved this rattle make a simple   design or a complicated one? The five different figures that make   up this rattle fit together like pieces of a puzzle. Imagine that   you have taken this puzzle apart. Would you still be able to   identify the figures if they were not attached to one another? If   you thought this was a simple design, has your answer changed?

Do you think it is possible to appreciate the rattle as a work of   art even though we can't see it as the artist originally intended it to appear?   <B>(No right answer.)</B> Challenge:  You are the curator of a museum's collection of   American Indian art.  Should you display this rattle as it is, without its   original painted colors, or should you attempt to repaint the rattle in order   to display it as the artist intended?  <B>(No right answer.)</B><br></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href=" introduction.html">Introduction</A> ~   <A HREF="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</A> ~   <A HREF="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</A> ~   <A HREF="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~   <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~   <A HREF="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</A> ~   <A HREF="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</A> ~   <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html   ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments   Wanted</A> ~ <A HREF="#Story">Story</A> ~   <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~   <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</center></table></A><HR>   <CENTER><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~   <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~   <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~   <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A><HR></BODY></HTML>
