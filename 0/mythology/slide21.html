Herincredible mountain residence was renowned for its marble and jasper buildings,nine-storied tower, sparkling brooks, and especially for its beautiful gardens.In the Land of the Immortals, bountiful peach trees grew.  One of the peachtrees in Hsi Wang-mu's orchard blossomed only once every 3,000 years.  Itsluscious fruit took an additional 3,000 years to ripen.  Anyone lucky enough toeat the magical fruit of this tree was granted immortality.  When the peacheswere harvested, Hsi Wang-mu held a huge celebration and feast at her home, atwhich her mortal visitors ate the precious peaches.  She also invited theimmortals to taste the fruit, since they, too, had to wait 6,000 years to enjoythis amazing delicacy.<p></ul><hr><ul><a name="Background"><center><b>Background</b></a></center><br><b>Ch'ien Lung</b><br> 		The Ch'ing dynasty emperor Ch'ien Lung (CHEE-en lung), who reigned from 1736 to 1795, was a devoted art collector andpatron.  He encouraged artists to produce many luxuryobjects, including fine lacquer presentation boxes, made as gifts for membersof the court.   <p><b>Lacquer</b><br>		Asian lacquer comes from the sap of the lac tree.  It is athick, sticky substance rather like honey.  Artists apply many thin layers oflacquer on wood objects, allowing each layer to harden for weeks before addinganother.  By applying layers in different colors, artists could then carve downthrough the layers to reveal various colors.  <p><b>Symbols</b><br>	Artists often decorated luxury objects with images and withsymbols of prosperity and good fortune.  Rather than tell stories literally(that would be too obvious) the Chinese used familiar symbols and images thatrecalled the story.<p>			Besides evoking stories, symbols can reveal the intentions and views ofHeaven.  Such symbols often appeared ineveryday contexts.  A series of earthquakes meant that Heaven was displeased;an early blossoming or the appearance of a crane might herald the coming ofgood fortune.  By using symbols such as the peach, artists recorded a generalwish for other heavenly signs of impending happiness and long life.<p><b>Peaches</b><br>		Peaches suggest many things in traditional Chinese culture.They were considered good medicine for everything from rheumatism to coughs.Children wore peach stones carved in the shapes of locks around their necks tokeep them from harm. The peach is commonly associated with springtime,marriage, fertility, and long life.   <p><b>Presentation Box</b><br>	The superb craftsmanship, intricate composition, and elaborate detail of this lacquer presentation box arecommon features of the fine lacquer produced during the reign of emperor Ch'ienLung.  It was probably made as a gift for a member of the nobility or even forthe emperor.  <p><b>Symbols</b><br>		This presentation box is covered with many symbols that wishits recipient good luck and happiness.  On top is a large character meaning"spring," which was considered one of the most fruitful and pleasant seasons.The peach was another symbol for springtime.  Below that is an elegant bowlfilled with symbols of wealth - coins and rhinoceros horns.  Illustrated on thesides are legends concerning immortality.  The combination of signs of spring,wealth, children, and long life suggests that this presentation box was made asa wedding gift or a birthday present.<p><b>Description</b><br>		The front of the box (see detail) shows the legend of HsiWang-mu's giant peach trees in the Land of the Immortals.  The land is abeautiful paradise of lofty mountains, cool wavy seas, and lush vegetation.  Onthe left, a peach tree grows out of the side of a cliff; the immense peachesdwarf the tree itself. Luckily for the immortals, the branches hang low enoughthat the peaches can be picked.  <p>			Two young boys and a wrinkled old man pick the luscious fruit. The old manis the god of longevity.  His staff bears the character <i>shou</i> (show),meaning "long life."  Standing on a ledge, one boy picks the peaches and handsthem to the god of longevity, who cradles them in a long cloth.  Behind the oldman, the other child picks off the leaves and places the peaches in a basket.<p>			Although the scene looks natural, it is carefully and decoratively composed.The figures stand on ground that is made up of a <a href="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</A> of squares and smallflowers.  The waves are reduced to a repetitive weave of diagonal lines.<p>			The artist, in a typical Chinese fashion, has created a sense of depth bytilting up the ground plane, so that more distant forms are set higher in thecomposition.  The stream winds upward into the distance.  <a href="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE"> PERSPECTIVE</A> shiftswithin the scene so that one can simultaneously look up at the mountains anddown on the heads of the figures.<p>			The artist also used color and texture to distinguish between <a href="glossary.html#FOREGROUND"> FOREGROUND</A> and<a href="glossary.html#BACKGROUND"> BACKGROUND</A> forms.  The black areas, deeply carved, form the water and the sky.Closer, the landscape forms a red backdrop for the figures and peaches, which,though also red, are carved from an even shallower layer of lacquer. </ul> <p><hr><center><b><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a> <br><ul><b>Look</b><br>			<B>1.</B>	This presentation box is covered with many <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</a> that wishthe box's owner good luck and happiness.
