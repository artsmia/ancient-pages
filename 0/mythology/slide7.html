Zeus had tricked Alcmene into believing   that he was her husband. Zeus's wife, Hera, was so jealous of her   husband's love for Alcmene that she made Herakles' life miserable.   When Herakles was a grown man with a family of his own, Hera sent   madness upon him and drove him to kill his entire family. He went   to the <A HREF="glossary.html#ORACLE">ORACLE</A> at Delphi   (DEL-fie) to seek penance for his horrific crime. The oracle told   him that he had to go see the king of Mycenae (my-SEE-nee) and do   whatever the king had told him to. When he completed the deeds,   his sins would be forgiven.<BR>   <BR>   The king of Mycenae first ordered Herakles to kill the Nemean   (nee-MEE-un) lion that had been threatening a nearby village for   many years. The village people told him it could not be killed by   weapon or arrow. Herakles tried to shoot the lion, but his arrows   could not wound the beast. Finally, he wrestled the lion to the   ground and strangled it with his hands. He kept the skin as proof   and wore it as a cloak, which gave him even greater strength.<BR>   <BR>   Herakles' second task was to capture a savage boar from the   mountain of Erymanthus (err-a-MAN-thus). Herakles trapped the   fearsome boar and brought it back alive to the king to prove he   had accomplished his task. The king was so frightened by the beast   that he ran and hid in a bronze jar.<BR>      <BR>      Much to everyone's amazement, Herakles went on to successfully   complete ten more seemingly impossible tasks. Because of him, many   people lived without fear. Zeus was so impressed by Herakles'   strength, courage, and hard work that he made him a god. Athena   (a-THEE-na) the goddess of war, wisdom, and the arts, came down   from Mount Olympus (OH-limp-US) in her chariot to carry Herakles   to live among the gods.</UL><HR><CENTER><B><A NAME="Background"></A>Background</B></center><UL>   <B>Herakles</B><BR>      Parts of Herakles' story are probably based on the life of a   historical figure, while other parts seem to be taken from the   myths of other eastern Mediterranean countries. In Greek   mythology, the hero Herakles personified physical strength and   courage. His repeated triumphs over evil, particularly his   successful completion of the 12 labors, earned him god status.   Throughout the ancient Greek world, Herakles was worshiped as a   protector.<BR>      <BR>      <B>History</B><BR>      Herakles was the most popular hero in 6th-century Athens, even   though none of his exploits was performed there. He appears   frequently on Athenian vases. Herakles' popularity was due in part   to his association with Athena, the patron goddess of Athens. She   protected Herakles against the evil doings of Hera.<BR>      <BR>      In his efforts to gain control of Athens, a 6th-century tyrant   named Peisistratus (pie-sis-trot-us) took advantage of the   well-known relationship between Athena and Herakles. He wanted   people to think of him as a modern Herakles-strong, unbeatable,   and heroic, so he staged a chariot procession to the Acropolis   (a-CROP-a-lus), pretending to be Herakles. Seated beside him was a   woman dressed up as Athena. This event inspired many vase   paintings of Herakles' apotheosis to Olympus, including scenes of   Athena with her chariot.<BR>      <BR>      <B>Antimenes Painter</B><BR>      The Antimenes (an-TIM-en-eez) painter painted many images of   Herakles and Athena together, responding to public demand for   timely themes in art. Although many Athenian vase painters did not   sign their work, art historians can identify them by stylistic   traits that recur in their paintings. This vases's theme,   extensive use of white, and composition helped art historians to   identify the artist as the Antimenes painter. He signed the name   Antimenes painter to only a few of the 150 vases attributed to   him.<BR>      <BR>      <B>Hydria</B><BR>      This vase, called a hydria, was used for carrying and pouring   water. The two handles on the sides were used for carrying, and   the third one, on the back, was used for pouring.<BR>      <BR>      <B>Style</B><BR>      The painting style of this vase is called black-figure because the   figures are rendered in black against the natural red color of the   clay. The artist drew the figures on the surface of the vase with   a clay and water solution called   <A HREF="glossary.html#ENGOBE">ENGOBE</A> (ON-gobe), which turned   black during the firing process. White and dark red accents were   added with separate solutions. The artist incised details into the   engobe before firing. For example, the lines that show details in   faces and clothing in this vase painting are all incised.<BR>      <BR>      <IMG SRC="Thumbnails/07a.gif" WIDTH=221 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=left hspace=8>This hydria exemplifies the qualities of harmony and symmetry,   highly prized by the Greeks. The orderly designs conform to the   different parts of the vase and accentuate its well-balanced,   harmonious proportions. (See Figure 6.) A circle of tongue   <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</A> (moe-TEEFS) decorate the   base of the vase and emphasize its function as the support of the   whole vessel. A circle of rays rises out of the base and draws the   viewer's attention to the paintings on the main body.<BR>   <BR clear=left><BR>   <B>Scenes</B><BR>   The main scene on the body of the hydria shows Athena in her   chariot, presumably having just descended from Mount Olympus to   take Herakles to live with the gods. Because the Greeks thought of   gods as humans, it is almost impossible to tell the difference   between the two in this scene. However, certain attributes readily   identified the most popular figures to the Greeks familiar with   their stories.   <P>Athena wears armor, which identifies her as the warrior goddess   and the protector of heros. She fought not for the sake of   destruction but for just causes. The cloak she wears is made of   serpents, a reference to the serpent-haired head of Medusa   (meh-DOO-sa) given to her by Perseus (PURR-see-us) after she   helped him to kill the evil gorgon. Her skin is white because vase   painters typically colored all women's skin white and men's skin   black.<BR>   <BR>   Herakles is shown in profile facing Athena in the middle of the   scene and is easily identifiable because he has the short spiky   hair of an athlete and a short beard. The figure to the left of   Herakles is Hermes (HER-meez), the messenger god, who guided   Herakles on his many journeys. Hermes is identified by his pointed   traveling hat and his long red beard. He is also carrying a   traveling staff in his left hand. The other figures are grooms who   assist Athena in harnessing the four horses to the chariot she and   Herakles will soon be riding to Mount Olympus.<BR>   <BR>   A band of lions and wild boars surrounds the bottom of the vase.   They represent the Nemean lion and the wild boar of Erymanthus   that Herakles had conquered as 2 of his 12 labors.<BR></UL><HR><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion Questions</B></center><UL>   <B>Look</B><BR>   <B>1.</B> Tell the story of Herakles.
