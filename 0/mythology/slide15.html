Abundant with leaves and fruit, the tree grew until its top reached heaven.  A celestial being appeared inNebuchadnezzar's dream and ordered him to cut down the tree, leaving only its roots bound in iron and bronze among the field grasses.  The same being then decreed that the king's mind be changed from a man's to a beast's.<br><br> Nebuchadnezzar did not understand his dream, so he called on the prophetDaniel to interpret it.  Daniel said that Nebuchadnezzar was the strong tree inhis dream.  He said that the dream was a decree from God that the mighty king who ruled without care for anyone but himself would be driven to dwell with beasts so that he would recognize God's superior power.  Nebuchadnezzar disregarded the dream's warning and continued to misuse his power.  When he failed to show mercy to those he oppressed, the dream came true.  Driven from human society, Nebuchadnezzar found himself eating grass as oxen do.  He was drenched by the dew of heaven, and his hair grew into eagles' feathers and his nails turned into birds' talons.</ul><br><hr><center><b><a name="Background"></A>Background</center></center></b><ul> <B>Nebchadnezzar</B><br>The story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and madness is one ofseveral moralizing, allegorical interpretations of historical events in the Book of Daniel, written in the 2nd century B.C. toillustrate the power of God.<br><br>Nebuchadnezzar II ruled over the Babylonian empire from 605 to 562 B.C.  In 586 B.C. he destroyed Jerusalem, and in 573 B.C. he captured Tyre.  Shortly thereafter he overran Egypt. Although there is no historical proof, it isthought that Nebuchadnezzar may have suffered from a mental illness calledInsania Zoanthropia, which causes humans to act like animals.<br><br><B>William Blake</B><br>The visionary poet and artist William Blake  despised the emphasis on rational thought so popular in 18th-century England.  Sir Isaac Newton's mathematic and scientific discoveries, which proved the existence of universal laws and the value of scientific reasoning, heralded the Age of Enlightenment in Europe.  Advancements in areas such as optics, chemistry, and biology encouraged intellectuals to put their trust in nature, as understood by reason, rather than in God.  Many people believed that they could rationally unlock nature's secrets to benefit their own lives. <br><br>			Blake, on the other hand, believed that imagination, not reason, was thedominant force of human nature.  He rebelled against the art establishment and created his own artistic vocabulary, often illustrating apocalyptic scenes from the Bible.  His bestial images, including his 1795 version of<i><B>Nebuchadnezzar</B></i>, illustrated the uncontrollable, irrational side of human beings.  He apparently intended this image of the mad king to be paired with an image of Newton that represented rational thought.<br><br> 	<B>Nebuchadnezzar</B><br>In this hand-colored print Blake depicts Nebuchadnezzar as part animal and part man.  The once-mighty Nebuchadnezzar crawls onhis hands and knees, and his feet sport bird's talons as described in the Bookof Daniel.  His golden hair, which was said to grow like an eagle's feathers,trails down his back and over his thighs.  His lengthy beard drags beneath histaut body.  Nebuchadnezzar's parted lips, furrowed brow, heavy eyelids, andespecially his staring eyes all lend his face an expression of helplessness.The king's strong muscled body, rendered in great detail, seems startlingly atodds with his mental instability.<br><br>			Nebuchadnezzar's crawling outdoors, nude, leaves no doubt of his madness.The large twisted tree trunks and foliage behind him may refer to the largetree in his dream.<br><br>			The imaginative and emotional tenor of Blake's stunning picture ofNebuchadnezzar relates it to works by other artists called <a href="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTICS</a>, who reacted against the staid <a href="glossary.html#NEOCLASSICISM">NEOCLASSICAL STYLE</a> with dramatic, often apocalypticimages.  But the distinctive style of this piece, marked by strong contourlines, is uniquely Blake's.  </ul><hr><center><b><a name=Questions></A>Discussion Questions</b></center><br><ul><B>Look</B><br><B>1.</B>	Before showing the image, tell the story.

How dohis choices of color and line associate the human figure with the surroundinglandscape?  <B>(Same colors used for figure and landscape.

However, Blakebelieved that imagination and emotion were the most important aspects of humannature.  If you wanted to choose people to represent the values of reason andemotion today, who would you choose?  Why?  <B>(Scientists, inventors, teachersmight represent reason.  Artists, performers, religious leaders might representemotion.)</B>  Can you think of people who might represent both?  <B>(Most people,including those groups listed above, lead lives in which reason, imagination,and emotion play equally important parts.)</B><p></ul><hr><table border=3><tr><td><center><a href="introduction.html">Introduction </a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth by Image</a> ~ <a href="culturelist.html">Myth by Culture</a> ~ <a href="myths.html">Mythological Comparisons </a> ~  <a href="glossary.html">Glossary </a> ~ <a href="suggestedreading.html">Suggested Readings</a>  ~  <a href="downloadables.html">Downloadable Resources</a> ~ <a href="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order </a> ~ <a href="myth_evaluation.html">Your Comments Wanted</a> ~ <a href="slide15.html#Story">Story</a> ~  <a href=slide15.html#Background>Background </a> ~ <a href="slide15.html#Questions">Questions</a></center></table><hr><center><A HREF="../index.html">Main Museum Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="../education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html">Curriculum Materials</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
