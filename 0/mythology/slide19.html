But the people of thatworld did not behave themselves.  Displeased, the Creating Power set out tomake a new world.  He sang several songs to bring rain, which poured strongerwith each song.  As he sang the fourth song, the earth split apart and watergushed up through the many cracks, causing a flood.  By the time the rainstopped, all of the people and nearly all of the animals had drowned.  OnlyKangi the crow survived. <P>			Kangi pleaded with the Creating Power to make him a new place to rest.  Sothe Creating Power decided the time had come to make his new world.  From hishuge pipe bag, which contained all types of animals and birds, the CreatingPower selected four animals known for their ability to remain under water for along time.  He sent each in turn to retrieve a lump of mud from beneath thefloodwaters.  First the loon dove deep into the dark waters, but it was unableto reach the bottom.  The otter, even with its strong webbed feet, also failed.Next, the beaver used its large flat tail to propel itself deep under thewater, but it too brought nothing back.  Finally, the Creating Power took theturtle from his pipe bag and urged it to bring back some mud.<p>			Turtle stayed under the water for so long that everyone was sure it haddrowned.  Then, with a splash, the turtle broke the water's surface!  Mudfilled its feet and claws and the cracks between its upper and lower shells.Singing, the Creating Power shaped the mud in his hands and spread it on thewater, where it was just big enough for himself and the crow.  He then shooktwo long eagle wing feathers over the mud until earth spread wide and varied,overcoming the waters.  Feeling sadness for the dry land, the Creating Powercried tears that became oceans, streams, and lakes.  He named the new landTurtle Continent in honor of the turtle who provided the mud from which it wasformed.   <p>			The Creating Power then took many animals and birds from his great pipe bagand spread them across the earth.  From red, white, black, and yellow earth, hemade men and women.  The Creating Power gave the people his sacred pipe andtold them to live by it.  He warned them about the fate of the people who camebefore them.  He promised all would be well if all living things learned tolive in harmony.  But the world would be destroyed again if they made it badand ugly.  <p></ul><hr><a name="Background"><center><b>Background</b></center></a><br><ul>	The Lakota were once part of a much larger group of people,the Dakota, who lived in the northern woodlands, including the southerntwo-thirds of Minnesota.  Within the Dakota were three closely related languagegroups - the Dakota-speakers, the Nakota-speakers, and the Lakota-speakers.  Allshared a sedentary life-style, living in bark lodges in the forests, harvestingwild rice, and making maple sugar.  Invasions by the French in the 1640s andensuing battles with their own Indian enemies forced many Nakota and Lakota tomove westward. They developed distinctive Plains cultures.  The Lakota acquiredhorses, introduced to North America by the Spanish in the 17th century, and bythe 18th century were nomadic buffalo hunters.<p> 			By the mid-19th century, Euro-American settlers had overrun the sacredlands of the Lakota, and white hunters had decimated the buffalo herds on whichthe Plains Indians depended. Eventually the United States government confinedthe Plains Indians to designated lands called reservations.  Althoughreservations deprived them of their traditional way of life, the Lakotastruggled to preserve many of their cultural traditions.<p><b>Quilling and Beading</b><br>		<a href="glossary.html#QUILLWORK">QUILLWORK</a> was the primary art form of traditional Lakota women.  They decorated clothing and other surfaces with <a href="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</a> designs elaborately embroidered with dyedporcupine or bird quills.  When colorful glass beads became readily availablefrom Euro-American traders, they began to replace quills in embroideredornamentation.  Beads were easier to acquire, easier to use, and came in a widevariety of bright colors.  Beadworkers strung several beads onto a thread andthen stitched them down at intervals to create colorful and often <a href="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLIC</a>patterns.  The forced immobility and economic hardships of reservation lifespurred a golden age in Lakota beadwork, especially as beaded objects becamevalued items in the tourist market.<p><b>Turtle</b><br>		Lakota dance dresses are traditionally decorated with a beadedyoke that incorporates the turtle-by-the-shore-of-the-lake design. Because ofher role in the creation story of the Lakota, the turtle is a sacred animal.The Lakota associate women with the sacred turtle because of their gift ofcreating human life.  Lakota women aspired to be like the turtle - resilient andlong-lived. Turtle <a href="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</a> (moe-TEEFS) were beaded on women's dresses, leggings,and bags and on cradle boards and protective umbilical amulets for baby girls.<p><b>Woman's Dress</b><br>	This was the "best dress" of a Lakota woman, wornfor dancing or for special occasions.  When a woman danced in this dress, the beaded yoke sparkled in the sunlight,the fringe swung up and down, and the bells jingled.<p>			The beaded designs on the yoke have spiritual power and significance.  Atthe lower center of the yoke, resting directly over the wearer's heart, is amulticolored U-shaped design representing the sacred turtle.  The narrow whitestrip across the width of the yoke is the lakeshore.  The blue-and-gold designin the white strip above the turtle may represent a morning star, and thecheckered designs around it may suggest mountains or hills.  Above the whitestrip, the broad blue area punctuated by <a href="glossary.html#SYMMETRY">SYMMETRICAL</a> designs represents thesky's reflection in the waters of the lake, the home of the sacred turtle.  While the meaning of most of these designsis no longer known, designs in this part of a Lakota dress traditionallyreferred to spiritual beings who lived in the sky and on the lakeshore.  By theearly 20th century, when this dress was made, Lakota artists often used suchdesigns for aesthetic or visual effect alone.</ul><p><hr><center><B><a name=Questions>Discussion Questions</b></center></a> <br><UL><b>Look</b><br>	<B>1.</B>	<b>Tell the Lakota story of the remaking of the world.
