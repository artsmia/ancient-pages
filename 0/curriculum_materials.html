These slide sets, print, audio and video materials provide teachers and community leaders access to the collection when they may not have any access to the museum itself.  These materials may also be used to complement a museum visit.  The Curriculum Materials Office also circulates selected materials produced by other organizations that relate to the museum's collection.   All of the materials and services for teachers are summarized in the <A HREF="tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A> which can be found in this area. <P>      All materials are designed to give teachers the tools they need to guide their students in critical examinations of works of art. In keeping with the museum's mission to promote cultural understanding, these materials capitalize on the diversity of the Institute's collection and its potential to promote cultural understanding.<p>  A large list of <A HREF="arts_resources.html">Arts Education related online resources</A> has also been compiled to assist you in accessing other art related sites.<p>For more information on the Curriculum Materials program contact:<br>The Curriculum Materials Office at (612) 870-3134<BR><HR><center><A HREF="index.html#index">Main Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="tta/tta_menu.html">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A></center><HR></html>
