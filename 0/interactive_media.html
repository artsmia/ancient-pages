Each program is unique and allows you to explore, according to your own interests, such areas as the culture, history, techniques, and artists behind our most important works of art.<P><B>Interactive Touch Screen Programs</B><UL><LI><A HREF="african_art.html">African Art and Culture</A><LI><A HREF="newancient.html">Ancient Art of the Mediterranean</A><LI><A HREF="paintings.html">The Art of Persuasion: 17th Century European Painting</A><LI><A HREF="americas.html">Art of the Americas</A><LI><A HREF="arts_japan.html">Arts of Japan</A><LI><A HREF="photo.html">From Silver to Silica: A History of Photography</A><LI><A HREF="museum_directory.html">Museum Directory</A></UL><B>About the Interactive Media Group</B><br>The <A HREF="img.html">Interactive Media Group</A> at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts produces all of the interactive programs in-house. The programs are presented on Macintosh computers, and in most cases, the graphics, animation, audio, and programming are stored directly on the computer's hard disk. Some of the programs use a videodisc player to display video sequences. The monitors are touch-sensitive and allow the visitor to make choices and navigate through the programs at his or her own pace.<p>The production of these programs was funded through a generous grant from the General Mills corporation.<p>For more information on The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Interactive Media programs contact the Interactive Media Group (612) 870-3211, Email: <I> <A HREF="mailto:miagen@mtn.org">miagen@mtn.org </A></I>.<BR><HR><center><A HREF="index.html#index">Main Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="education.html">Educational Programs</A> ~ <A HREF="african_art.html">African Art and Culture</A> ~ <A HREF="newancient.html">Ancient Art of the Mediterranean</A> ~ <A HREF="paintings.html">The Art of Persuasion: 17th Century European Painting</A> ~ <A HREF="americas.html">Art of the Americas</A> ~ <A HREF="arts_japan.html">Arts of Japan</A> ~ <A HREF="photo.html">From Silver to Silica: A History of Photography</A> ~ <A HREF="museum_directory.html">Museum Directory</A></center><HR></html>
