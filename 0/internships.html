All candidates with skills, interests, or experiences relevant to museum work are eligible for internships.<P>Internships may range from one to twelve months in length, with a minimum time commitment of twenty hours per week expected.  Intern positions are typically project-oriented within a specific department. A monthly classroom component acquaints interns with various functions, programs, departments, and staff of the museum.  Students often arrange academic credit for their internship experience through their college or university.<P>The availability of internships is determined by the needs of individual departments throughout the year.  Within the limitations of staff and space availability, exhibition schedules, and the varying potential for challenging intern projects, candidates may consider internships in several areas of the museum, including the Library, Curatorial, Education, Marketing and Communications, Development, and Registration departments.<P>For more information on the Internship program contact:<BR>Internship Coordinator (612) 870-3189<BR><HR><center><A HREF="index.html#index">Main Menu</A> ~ <A HREF="opportunities.html">Opportunities for Involvement</A></center><HR></HTML>
