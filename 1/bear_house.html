The exterior is trimmed         in hand- carved Honduras mahogany with a dormered, birch bark roof and         a cupola topped by green, leaf-shaped tiles. The upstairs floors are bare         wood; the kitchen floors are wood that has been finished to resemble terra         cotta tiles. The furnishings include three chairs, bowls and beds plus         one table - everything needed for your bears to live comfortably! This         durable house is meant for touch, not just looking, and makes a wonderful         treasure to pass through generation after generation. </p>      <p>Raffle tickets are $3 each and can be purchased at the Visitor &amp;         Member Services Center.
