He photographed         hundreds of subjects engaged in actions both mundane and arcane: nude         figures walking and lifting children, athletes boxing and fencing, and         animals hurdling, kicking, or slowly ambling along. He was the first photographer         to visually dissect these activities, creating images that delighted and         mystified the public in the late 19th century.</p>      <p align="left"> Hired in 1872 to settle a bet on whether a galloping horse         has all four feet off the ground at once, Muybridge eventually secured         a photographic silhouette proving that it does&#150;an artistic and scientific         revelation. In 1883, he began working at the University of Pennsylvania         on a full-scale investigation of human and animal locomotion. With suggestions         from local experts, including the artist Thomas Eakins, he commenced photographing         subjects that would serve artists, physiologists, and veterinarians. He         made numerous improvements to his equipment that enabled him to take more         and better images.</p>      <p align="left">In 1887, the university published Muybridge's results&#150;a         set of 781 photographic sequences titled Animal Locomotion, which were         eagerly purchased by artists and universities. Muybridge's impressive         investigation of the way we humans move remains the most encyclopedic         study of its kind. </p></td>  </tr></table><p align="left">&nbsp; </p><P align="center"><a href="index.html"><img src="backmain.gif"         X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight align=bottom width=136 height=23 border="0"></a> </P><P><CENTER>    <BR>    <BR>  </CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
