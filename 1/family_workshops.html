The first session, held at pARTs gallery,         focuses on how the camera works and the printing process. After learning         what makes a picture a portrait, class participants have their family         portraits taken with an antique 4x5 camera and then create their own portfolio         of city portraits in the surrounding neighborhood. In the second session,         held at the MIA, participants examine their developed portfolios, explore         the special photography exhibition, <i><b>Roy DeCarava: Retrospective</b></i>,         and learn how to interpret their own city portraits through the technique         of photomontage.       <p>Classes are held on two consecutive Sundays, first at pARTs, 711 West         Lake Street (612/824-5500), and then at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts         in classroom 112/113.
