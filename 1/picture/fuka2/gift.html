People   told him about Eva Fuka, a famous Czech photographer then living in the United   States. When Peterson returned to the U.S., he called Fuka and she invited him   for dinner. Together they looked through her photographs. When Peterson told   Fuka The Minneapolis Institute of Arts would like to have some of her photos   for its collection, Fuka offered to give them to the museum. Peterson selected   six photos because of their Surrealist quality, which he considered her signature   element. He also selected Prague Castle as a document of Czechoslovakia, and   because he knew there weren&#146;t many photos of Czechoslovakia in the collection   at the Museum.</p><p>Why would Fuka want to give photos to the museum as a gift? Artists are often   happy to give museums works of art rather than sell them because it looks good   to be able to say your work is in the collection of a museum. Look for &#147;Gift   of the Artist&#148; on information labels next to works of art next time you   visit a museum. Can anyone give their work to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts   as a gift? No, in fact the museum has a policy against it. Don&#146;t send your   photos to the museum. If <i>you</i> could, then everyone would. In order to   give your photos to the museum as a gift, you have to be invited. </p></body></html>
