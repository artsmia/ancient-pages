But what, exactly,       should she photograph? Abbott&#146;s road to inspiration was another Paris       photographer, Eugene Atget. For years Atget had been taking photographs       of Paris&#151;streets, people, buildings and storefronts. He made a living       selling prints to artists, historians and anyone else who was interested,       but his main motivation was to make a photographic record of the city he       adored. When Berenice Abbott saw Atget&#146;s photographs she was captivated.       Here was everything she knew photography could be. Impersonal and factual,       sophisticated compositions in realistic documents. &quot;His compositions       were just about perfect.&quot; said Abbott. &quot;He knew absolutely where       to put his camera. The art is in selecting what is worthwhile to take the       trouble about.&quot; (Kay Weaver and Martha Wheelock, <i>Berenice Abbott,       A View of the 20th Century</i>, Ishtar Films, 1992) When Atget died a few       months after their meeting, Abbott bought all of his negatives and shipped       them to the United States. She would spend the next 40 years caring for       the collection, promoting Atget&#146;s photos, arranging exhibitions and       writing books about his work, just because she loved it.</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
