But New York is the only city in the world rich enough               in money, vitality, and men to build itself anew . . . the only               city sufficiently wealthy to be modern.</font></p>            <p align="right"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#151;Bernard               Fey, <i>The American Experiment</i>, 1929</font></p>            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big event               in 1929 New York was the October stock-market crash that set the               stage for the Great Depression. But Berenice Abbott had arrived               just in time to witness the birth of the New York skyscraper. The               Chrysler building was finished in 1929, with the Empire State building               and Rockefeller Center not far behind. No one in Europe had seen               anything like these spiked towering symbols of modernism. Europe               was old, New York was new, built by daring construction workers               including Mohawk men hired for their strength, skill and fearlessness               at heights that would leave others dizzy and gasping.</font></p>            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Museum               of Modern Art opened its doors in 1929. Prohibition was in effect,               but that didn't stop &quot;flappers&quot; those modern, sassy young               women in short dresses who smoked cigarettes and drank liquor in               public. Jazz was the new music, created by such innovators as Louis               Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton. They produced what               many consider to be America's greatest gift to music.</font></p>            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Jazz Age               in New York owed its beginnings to the fact that the Harlem Renaissance               was in full swing in 1929. Throughout the 1920s, men and women from               all over the country came together in Harlem to form an African               American social and intellectual movement of terrific energy. Poets,               writers, artists, dancers, playwrights, actors, photographers, musicians               and more reaped the benefits of the thriving cultural center that               was Harlem.</font></p>            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the second               annual Academy Awards (known as &quot;The Oscars&quot;) in 1929,               The Broadway Melody won &quot;Best Picture.&quot; It was MGM's first               full-length musical feature, advertised as &quot;all-talking, all-singing,               all dancing,&quot; including memorable hits such as &quot;Give My               Regards to Broadway.&quot; It was not surprising that a movie about               Broadway received top honors. In 1929, New Yorkers attended plays               on Broadway as often as people go to movies today. <br>              Also new in 1929 were car radios and experiments on electronic color               television. In 1929 Babe Ruth held the American League record for               home runs. Berenice Abbott couldn&#146;t fly to New York from Paris,               but for the first time she could telephone New York from aboard               her ship while crossing the Atlantic.</font></p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font size="+1" color="#3333FF"><br>        Berenice Abbott knew</font> Eugene Atget for only a few months before         he died, but from the moment she saw his photographs of Paris&#151;streets,         people, buildings and storefronts&#151;she knew she had found something         special. She bought Atget&#146;s entire collection, more than 1,000 glass         negatives and 7,000 prints, and brought them to the United States to promote         them to museums, galleries, and art and photography magazines.</p>      <p>When Berenice Abbott arrived in New York in 1929 with Atget&#146;s photos,         she was planning on a three-week visit. She had been living in Europe         for eight years, where she had an established and successful photography         business. But what she saw in New York took her breath away. Unbelievable         wealth and heart-breaking poverty; cars, trains and trolleys among horse-drawn         milk carts; straight-sided skyscrapers soaring up around old ramshackle         buildings; rectangles everywhere; an intense machine of a city. Abbott         never returned to Paris. Instead she began photographing New York just         as Atget had photographed Paris. She wanted to make a photographic record         of this city of contrasts. But Abbott would photograph New York in her         own way, imposing her love of facts and her belief that photography, a         twentieth-century invention, was the only medium worthy of capturing twentieth-century         New York. She set up a studio in Manhattan and spent the next ten years         photographing New York.</p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
