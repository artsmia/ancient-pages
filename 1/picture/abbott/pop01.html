But New York is the only city in the world rich enough in money, vitality,   and men to build itself anew . . . the only city sufficiently wealthy to be   modern.</p><p align="right">&#151;Bernard Fey, <i>The American Experiment</i>, 1929</p><p>The big event in 1929 New York was the October stock-market crash that set   the stage for the Great Depression. But Berenice Abbott had arrived just in   time to witness the birth of the New York skyscraper. The Chrysler building   was finished in 1929, with the Empire State building and Rockefeller Center   not far behind. No one in Europe had seen anything like these spiked towering   symbols of modernism. Europe was old, New York was new, built by daring construction   workers including Mohawk men hired for their strength, skill and fearlessness   at heights that would leave others dizzy and gasping.</p><p>The Museum of Modern Art opened its doors in 1929. Prohibition was in effect,   but that didn't stop &quot;flappers&quot; those modern, sassy young women in   short dresses who smoked cigarettes and drank liquor in public. Jazz was the   new music, created by such innovators as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and   Jelly Roll Morton. They produced what many consider to be America's greatest   gift to music.</p><p>The Jazz Age in New York owed its beginnings to the fact that the Harlem Renaissance   was in full swing in 1929. Throughout the 1920s, men and women from all over   the country came together in Harlem to form an African American social and intellectual   movement of terrific energy. Poets, writers, artists, dancers, playwrights,   actors, photographers, musicians and more reaped the benefits of the thriving   cultural center that was Harlem.</p><p>At the second annual Academy Awards (known as &quot;The Oscars&quot;) in 1929,   <i>The Broadway Melody</i> won &quot;Best Picture.&quot; It was MGM's first   full-length musical feature, advertised as &quot;all-talking, all-singing, all   dancing,&quot; including memorable hits such as &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway.&quot;   It was not surprising that a movie about Broadway received top honors. In 1929,   New Yorkers attended plays on Broadway as often as people go to movies today. </p><p>Also new in 1929 were car radios and experiments on electronic color television.   In 1929 Babe Ruth held the American League record for home runs. Berenice Abbott   couldn&#146;t fly to New York from Paris, but for the first time she could telephone   New York from aboard her ship while crossing the Atlantic.</p></body></html>
