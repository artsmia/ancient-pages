In 1935,         the federal government funded Abbott's project through the <a href="#wpa">Works         Progress Administration,</a> enabling her to spend all of her time photographing         New York. But the government never approved her purchase of a small, portable         camera suitable for taking pictures of people on the street in live-action         settings. Then, in 1938, the funding for her project was cut. In December         of that year, as she was printing the final pictures for her survey of         New York, she told an interviewer, &quot;There are lots of things I could         have taken in the last five years, if I only had better cameras &#133;         You want to get a crowd of people really protesting something. If you         try to get the expression on their faces, you are stuck &#133;&quot; (Robert         W. Marks, <i>Coronet,</i> December 1938)</p>      <p>Even though Abbott&#146;s New York photographs seldom include figures         they do include people in an indirect way. Abbott's New York was a city         full of the things people made, thus reflecting peoples&#146; lives. As         Art News writer Avis Berman pointed out, &quot;Abbott's true theme was         the secret life of inanimate things. [She] embraced an austere vision         of life and&#133; used light to reveal that the products of human ingenuity         have a quivering presence, if not a superior personality, for those who         care to seek them.&quot; (Avis Berman,<i> Art News,</i> January 1981)</p>      <a name="wpa"></a>       <table border="0" bgcolor="#F0EDBB" cellpadding="12" width="100%">        <tr>           <td>             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Works Progress               Administration (WPA)</b></font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Works Progress               Administration was formed in 1935.
