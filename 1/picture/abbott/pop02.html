But what, exactly, should         she photograph? Abbott&#146;s road to inspiration was another Paris photographer,         Eugene Atget. For years Atget had been taking photographs of Paris&#151;streets,         people, buildings and storefronts. He made a living selling prints to         artists, historians and anyone else who was interested, but his main motivation         was to make a photographic record of the city he adored. When Berenice         Abbott saw Atget&#146;s photographs she was captivated. Here was everything         she knew photography could be. Impersonal and factual, sophisticated compositions         in realistic documents. &quot;His compositions were just about perfect.&quot;         said Abbott. &quot;He knew absolutely where to put his camera. The art         is in selecting what is worthwhile to take the trouble about.&quot; (Kay         Weaver and Martha Wheelock,<i> Berenice Abbott, A View of the 20th Century</i>,         Ishtar Films, 1992) When Atget died a few months after their meeting,         Abbott bought all of his negatives and shipped them to the United States.         She would spend the next 40 years caring for the collection, promoting         Atget&#146;s photos, arranging exhibitions and writing books about his         work, just because she loved it.</p>      <p><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')">I get it!</a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
