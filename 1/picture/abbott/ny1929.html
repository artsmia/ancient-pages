But New York is the only city in the world rich enough in money,           vitality, and men to build itself anew&#133;the only city sufficiently           wealthy to be modern.</i></p>        <p align="right">&#151;Bernard Fey, <i>The American Experiment,</i> 1929</p>      </blockquote>      <p>The big event in 1929 New York was the October stock-market crash that         set the stage for the Great Depression. But Berenice Abbott arrived in         New York before October, just in time to witness the birth of the New         York skyscraper. The Chrysler building was finished that year, with the         Empire State building and Rockefeller Center not far behind. No one in         Europe had seen anything like these spiked towering symbols of modernism.         Europe was old, New York was new, built by daring construction workers         including Mohawk men hired for their strength, skill and fearlessness         at heights that would leave others dizzy and gasping.</p>      <p>The Museum of Modern Art opened its doors in 1929. Prohibition was in         effect, but that didn't stop &quot;flappers&quot; those modern, sassy         young women in short dresses who smoked cigarettes and drank liquor in         public. Jazz was the new music, created by such innovators as Louis Armstrong,         Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton. They produced what many consider         to be America's greatest gift to music.</p>      <p>The Jazz Age in New York owed its beginnings to the fact that the Harlem         Renaissance was in full swing in 1929. Throughout the 1920s, men and women         from all over the country came together in Harlem to form an African American         social and intellectual movement of terrific energy. Poets, writers, artists,         dancers, playwrights, actors, photographers, musicians and more reaped         the benefits of the thriving cultural center that was Harlem.</p>      <p>At the second annual Academy Awards (known as &quot;The Oscars&quot;)         in 1929, <i>The Broadway Melody</i> won &quot;Best Picture.&quot; It was         MGM's first full-length musical feature, advertised as &quot;all-talking,         all-singing, all dancing,&quot; including memorable hits such as &quot;Give         My Regards to Broadway.&quot; It was not surprising that a movie about         Broadway received top honors. In 1929, New Yorkers attended plays on Broadway         as often as people go to movies today. </p>      <p>Also new in 1929 were car radios and experiments on electronic color         television. In 1929 Babe Ruth held the American League record for home         runs. Berenice Abbott couldn&#146;t fly to New York from Paris, but for         the first time she could telephone New York from aboard her ship while         crossing the Atlantic.</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#927830124550')" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="I got it!" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
