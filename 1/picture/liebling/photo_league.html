Rejecting other popular forms of photography like sentimental         portraits or pretty landscapes, these photographers were interested in         ordinary working people and the conditions under which they lived. Jerome         Liebling joined the League when he was a 22-year-old photography student         at Brooklyn College. The League&#146;s statement of beliefs read, in part:         &#147;Photography has tremendous social value. Upon the photographer rests         the responsibility and duty of recording a true image of the world as         it is today. The Photo League&#146;s task is to put the camera back in         the hands of honest photographers, who will use it to photograph America.&#148;         (<i>Documentary Photography,</i> 1972) The unwritten part of The Photo         League&#146;s beliefs was that its members would also use photography         to promote social change.</p>      <p>The Photo League published a free newsletter, <i>Photo Notes</i>. The         League also ran a school where students paid $30 for a 12-session semester         of classes on the history, techniques and philosophies of photography.         Students were never turned away if they couldn&#146;t pay. The Photo League         and its members soon became known all over the country as students graduated         and traveled, making pictures and carrying The Photo League&#146;s philosophy         to other communities outside of New York City.</p>      <p>&#147;I thought of photography as a means of self expression,&#148; wrote         League member Lou Bernstein, &#147;and the League&#146;s philosophy suited         me because it emphasized the expression of personal viewpoints, even in         the photographs we took of social conditions. I think that&#146;s an attitude         that is missing in almost all of the photography schools today; there         should be an institution that encourages young photographers to express         themselves.&#148; (Lou Bernstein, <i>Documentary Photography</i>, 1972)</p>      <p>The Photo League disbanded in the late 1940s after its members were criticized         by the Department of Justice for having Communist sympathies. A few members         of The Photo League were accused of being members of the Communist Party.         Some photographs, because they championed common people and frequently         exposed social injustice, were interpreted as critical of America&#146;s         values and its government. For a time membership grew as other photographers         joined the League to show their support. In the end, however, most members         realized that their careers were in peril and decided to resign.</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933178081383')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
