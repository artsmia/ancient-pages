We miss him           so much. If ever we needed advice or help. He was always there. I can&#146;t           find words that could tell you how much you have done for us by your           picture of our PA PA.</p>        <p>It was such a beautiful day today. My husband and I met some of the           rest of the family, and we went to the Minn. Institute of Arts to see           you collection. It was fabulous. You captured so many people of all           kinds. In a time when things were hard. There were a lot people through           out the institute. We were standing at the picture of our PA PA and           the attendant came over to us. She ask us if we knew the man in the           picture, because she heard us talking. We said yes. It was our PA PA.           Now after all these years he is able to travel and see the world. Thanks           to you.</p>      </blockquote>      <p>Liebling was so proud of the letter he included it in his book, <i>The         Minnesota Photographs</i></p><p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933178081383')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
