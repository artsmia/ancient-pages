Pope had not entered his work in the competition;         he just showed up and asked Hartwell to take a look at his pictures. He         hadn&#146;t submitted his photographs for the competition because, he         recalled, &#147;I felt burnt out about showing around Indianapolis and         people used to say the most insulting things to me about my work. I felt         they didn&#146;t have any understanding of my work or the history of photography         and I just quit showing my work around here.&#148; After viewing hundreds         of photos on his trip to Indianapolis, Hartwell purchased only Pope&#146;s         for the museum. &#147;It was one of the first institutions that ever collected         my work,&#148; remembers Pope.</p>      <p> Hartwell purchased four of Pope&#146;s photographs for the collection         at the Institute, and Pope gave the museum another four. &#147;I wanted         to donate the others because I wanted them to stay all together,&#148;         said Pope. &#147;I wanted the museum to have a set. Even though I was         in my twenties I already understood the history of photography and the         importance of my work being conserved.&#148; </p>      <p> Any artists whose work lives in a museum&#146;s collection can be certain         that it will be well preserved. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts stores         photographs in climate-controlled rooms, sealed from dust and light which         could damage delicate paper. In fact, as Pope knew, most artists aren&#146;t         able to care for their work as well as a museum can.</p>      <p> The purchase of Pope&#146;s work turned out to be a great deal for both         the photographer and the museum. Pope knew the Institute would preserve         his work for the future, and Hartwell was pleased to get eight photographs         for the price of four. &#147;The price was real low,&#148; recalls Pope,         &#147;and I still try to keep it low for institutions in this early part         of my career. Even though I am 38 years-old I still feel like it is early.&#148;</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933169366766')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
