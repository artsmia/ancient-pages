He tirelessly promoted photography         as an art form by working as a writer, editor, curator, gallery owner         and a publisher. </p>      <p>In 1903 Stieglitz published the first issue of <i>Camera Work</i>, a         quarterly publication that became the vehicle for photographers interested         in photography as art. </p>      <p>As creator, editor and publisher of <i>Camera Work</i>, Stieglitz demanded         excellence of the photographers whose work he printed in the magazine.         In the first issue of <i>Camera Work</i>, he wrote, &#147;Only examples         of such work as gives evidence of individuality and artistic worth, regardless         of school, or contains some exceptional feature of technical merit, or         such as exemplifies some treatment worthy of consideration, will find         recognition in these pages.&#148; (<i>Camera Work</i>, No. 1, 1903)</p>      <p>The photographs in<i> Camera Work</i> were beautifully reproduced portraits,         landscapes or everyday scenes such as city streets or families at home.         Stories and poems that were examples of experimental and modern literature,         and critical essays and reports about photography were also included.         Stieglitz had gathered a circle of artists, photographers, writers and         thinkers, but he always insisted on complete creative control. Fifty issues         of <i>Camera Work</i> were published, and it is still thought of today         as one of the most beautiful magazines devoted to pictorial photography         ever produced.</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933178081383')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
