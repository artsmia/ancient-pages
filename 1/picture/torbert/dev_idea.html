The MacDowell Colony is a colony for visual artists,         writers and composers that&#146;s in Peterborough, New Hampshire. You         apply for it and you get to go, like a grant. You have to be invited and         you meet a lot of interesting people there. The first time I went there         I stopped in New York on the way and I bought all kinds of paper and colored         pencils. I hadn&#146;t drawn for a long time, at least fifteen years.       </p>      <p> &#147;I got to MacDowell and at first I was very upset to be there.         I had this studio in the woods that was completely empty and completely         white and it was winter and white outside and white inside. I like white         and I like light but it seemed extremely sterile to me and I didn&#146;t         know what I was going to do there. So I started drawing the landscape         and just responding to what was outside my door. </p>      <p> &#147;That was a really good experience for me. And then I began to         photograph it and then there began to be sort of a dialogue between my         photographs and my drawings. Those drawings that I first did there were         pencil. Much more realistic than what I later went on to do. </p>      <p> &#147;I went back to MacDowell in 1992 and did these very large paintings         that were very gestural and that were interpretations of weather patterns         as seen from satellites. They were bright colors and really about movement         and getting my body involved, because I used to be a dancer many years         ago. They were done just with the intent that they be paintings. I didn&#146;t         think of them as part of a photograph at all. Later, I was growing an         amaryllis in my studio, and it was so beautiful and intriguing in all         its different stages that I wanted to photograph it. I thought, maybe         there&#146;s some way that I can use these paintings with the photographs         to just sort of speak about energy. So I did that. </p>      <p> &#147;Then I started to combine other plant materials with other drawings         and paintings that I had done. Some of the landscapes were done on location         in pastel and I later decided to use them in photographs, so it wasn&#146;t         like I conceived the whole thing all at once and I saw that I wanted a         particular kind of sky behind a particular kind of plant. It was all part         of an inner dialogue that was ongoing with myself, that I kept adding         to and getting new ideas from my work.&#148;</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933169366766')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
