Members of Magnum are         represented by the agency when anyone buys their photos or photo essays         for the media. Magazines and newspapers are the most frequent clients.         Magnum also accepts assignments from the media, to cover newsworthy events         around the world. Belonging to Magnum is different from working as a freelance         photojournalist or as a staff photographer for a newspaper or magazine.       </p>      <p> Magnum photographers have a say in how their pictures appear, what publications         they will appear in, and the captions that go with the pictures. It&#146;s         part of the deal when publications buy photos from Magnum. </p>      <p> Photographers retain the rights to their own photos when they belong         to Magnum. When photographers work on staff at magazines or newspapers,         or when these publications buy photos from freelance photographers, the         publication often requires that the photographer turn over all rights         to images. This means that the publication can resell the photo, without         paying extra fees to the photographer.</p>      <p> Because Magnum photographers retain the rights to their photos they         benefit financially whenever their work is sold, and re-sold by Magnum.         This allows Magnum photographers like Gilles Peress the financial freedom         to pursue stories in Bosnia or Rwanda without receiving the assignment         directly or selling the photos ahead of time. This arrangement also allowed         Peress to go where other photographers could not go in Iran, because he         was working independently, not withAmerican news organizations or publications.         In Iran, all American correspondents were confined to the area just outside         the American Embassy in Teheran. </p>      <p> Can anyone be a member of Magnum? Nope; you have to be invited!</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="right"><a href="#" onClick="window.close();" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933622202350')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" name="gotit"></a></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
