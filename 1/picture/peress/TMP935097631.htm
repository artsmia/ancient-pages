Of course they have two eyes, but Peress has captured exactly         the moment when one eye is covered. It is a device he uses a lot. He seems         to search for that moment when one eye is looking directly at him, and         he is of course looking back through the camera&#146;s viewfinder, also         with one eye.</p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
