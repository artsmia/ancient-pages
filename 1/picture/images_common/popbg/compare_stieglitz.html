The pictorial movement, led by photographer Alfred Stieglitz         and others, set out to make pictures that proved photographs were art,         not just tools that real artists (painters) used to remember what their         subjects looked like. Berenice Abbott hated this notion. &quot;What to         me is anathema is for photography to be a bad excuse for another medium.         Anything that smacks of painting, charcoal drawing, etching or aquatint         is outmoded,&quot; she wrote in her book <i>New Guide to Better Photography.</i>         &quot;In fact, trying to make a photograph look like an etching is just         as bad as the fallacy in architecture of building a skyscraper with steel         frame construction and then covering up the basic form with pseudo-Gothic         ornament. Let the medium speak for itself, frankly as what it is, the         twentieth-century picture-making art.&quot; Abbott often quoted fellow         photographer Peter Henry Emerson, who wrote in 1886: &quot;Avoid prettiness&#151;the         word looks much like pettiness, and there is but little difference between         them.&quot; (Berenice Abbott, <i>New Guide to Better Photography,</i>         1953)</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')"><img src="../got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
