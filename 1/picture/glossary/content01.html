A common       brand name for a color coupler print is <i>Kodak C print.</i> It&#146;s       a complicated process; the name refers to colored dyes coupled with light-sensitive       silver compounds. The colors in these prints look very natural, accounting       for their popularity. </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="dye_bleach"></a>Dye       bleach color print -</font></i></b> There are three layers of gelatin on       paper used to produce a dye bleach color print. Each layer contains light-sensitive       silver halides and a colored dye. When the paper is exposed to light shown       through a color negative, three positive images of dye and silver are produced,       one on top of the other. Then the silver is bleached out, leaving only the       color images. A common brand name for this type of color print is <i>Cibachrome.</i>       These prints typically contain more contrast than those produced by other       methods of color printing, making them more dramatic. They are also chemically       stable and are appreciated for their durability.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="gelatin_silver_print"></a>Gelatin       silver print -</font></i></b> A fancy name for the common black-and-white       photograph, this process has remained largely unchanged since it was introduced       in the 1880s. Paper is coated with gelatin that holds light-sensitive silver       halide particles. Light shone through a negative strikes the paper, activating       the silver particles. The paper is placed in a chemical developing solution       that allows the transformed silver particles to be seen by the human eye       as black, white, and all the gray tones in between.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="hand_colored"></a>Hand-colored       gelatin silver print -</font></i></b> Color is added by hand to the surface       of a black-and-white photograph. Artists have used a variety of media and       techniques to hand-color photographs, including watercolor and other paints       and dyes applied with brushes, cotton swabs and airbrushes. Carl Pope hand-colored       his photographs with oil paint and brushes.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="view_camera"></a>Large-format       view camera -</font></i></b> A large camera typically able to accommodate       4&nbsp;x&nbsp;5, 5&nbsp;x&nbsp;7 and 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;10-inch sheet film. It       is called a view camera because of its ground-glass viewing screen, which       shows the photographer exactly what the film will record. The image on the       glass viewing screen is not very bright, and to see it clearly photographers       put a black focusing cloth over the back of the camera, covering their heads.       View cameras have adjustable parts, and problems of distortion or focus       can be corrected by changing the positions of the lens and the back of the       camera which holds the film.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="photogravure"></a>Photogravure       -</font></i></b> French for &#147;photo engraving,&#148; this is an etching       method used to reproduce photographs. A copper plate is covered with material       that hardens upon exposure to light. The plate can be exposed by shining       light through a negative as if the plate is photographic paper. Any material       not struck by light remains soft and is washed away. The exposed area of       the copper plate is etched in an acid bath, and inked and printed, transferring       the original image onto paper. The copper plate can be inked and printed       over and over, making it a good method for reproducing images in large quantities.       Photogravures have a slightly grainy quality that pleased Alfred Stieglitz       and other pictorialists, and most of the photos in <i>Camera Work</i> are       reproduced by this process.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="rangefinder"></a>Rangefinder       camera -</font></i></b> A photographer using a rangefinder camera views       the scene to be photographed through a peephole equipped with a simple lens       system that approximates what the picture will be. A common brand name is       <i>Leica.</i> This type of camera is often favored by street photographers       and photojournalists because it is small, lightweight, and quiet.</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="slr"></a>Single-lens       reflex camera -</font></i></b> The viewing system of a single-lens reflex       camera is built around a mirror. Light coming through the lens is reflected       upward by a mirror (thus the name reflex), then to the back of the camera       by a prism. This system allows the photographer to see what the camera lens       sees through a viewfinder in the back of the camera. Single-lens reflex       cameras have been made to hold a variety of film sizes over the years, and       a wide number of accessories, such as flashes, are available. Since the       photographer sees what the lens &#147;sees,&#148; this camera works well       with all types of lenses. Today, exposure meters built into the camera are       designed to allow photographers to measure light seen through the lens.       All of these features make the single-lens reflex camera quick and easy       to use. Most common are 35 mm cameras made by companies such as <i>Nikon</i>       and <i>Pentax.</i> </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="telex"></a>Telex       -</font></i></b> Short for &#147;teleprinter exchange,&#148; telexes were       messages transmitted over a global wire system by big, noisy machines that       looked like typewriters. They were a forerunner to fax machines, but more       sophisticated than telegrams, which had to be sent to a main telegraph office,       translated from dots and dashes, then hand-delivered to the receiver. Telex       machines were easily wired and not too expensive, so they were commonly       found in offices that conducted international business.</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td><b><i><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="diana"></a>Toy       camera - Diana type -</font></i></b> A mass produced plastic rangefinder       camera primarily designed for children and beginning photographers. One       brand popular during the 1950s was called Diana. These toy cameras lack       the precision of more sophisticated rangefinder cameras. Their plastic lenses       can cause distortion, there are typically just a few exposure settings,       and the camera cannot be focused. </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top"><img src="../images_common/star.gif" width="11" height="9"></td>    <td>       <p> <font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b><a name="twin_lens"></a>Twin-lens         reflex camera -</b></i></font> Similar to the single-lens reflex camera,         the twin-lens reflex camera contains a mirror that reflects light onto         a ground-glass viewing screen at the top of the camera. The photographer         holds the camera at waist level and looks down onto the viewing screen         to see the image the camera sees through the viewing lens. The twin-lens         reflex camera has a second lens below the viewing lens that directs light         onto the film. The result is that the photographer views an image projected         by one lens, while the film is exposed through another. Since the lenses         are placed one above the other on the front of the camera there is usually         only a slight difference in what the two lenses &#147;see.&#148; </p>      </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
