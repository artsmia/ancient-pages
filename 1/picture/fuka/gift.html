When Peterson returned to the U.S., he called Fuka       and she invited him for dinner. Together they looked through her photographs.       When Peterson told Fuka The Minneapolis Institute of Arts would like to       have some of her photos for its collection, Fuka offered to give them to       the museum. Peterson selected six photos because of their Surrealist quality,       which he considered her signature element. He also selected Prague Castle       as a document of Czechoslovakia, and because he knew there weren&#146;t       many photos of Czechoslovakia in the collection at the Museum.       <p>Why would Fuka want to give photos to the museum as a gift? Artists are         often happy to give museums works of art rather than sell them because         it looks good to be able to say your work is in the collection of a museum.         Look for &#147;Gift of the Artist&#148; on information labels next to         works of art next time you visit a museum. Can anyone give their work         to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts as a gift? No, in fact the museum         has a policy against it. Don&#146;t send your photos to the museum. If<i>         </i>you could, then everyone would. In order to give your photos to the         museum as a gift, you have to be invited. </p>      <p><a href="letter.html">See the letter she sent.</a></p><p align="right"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window.close();')" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.gotit','document.gotit','../images_common/got_it2.gif','#933169366766')"><img src="../images_common/got_it1.gif" width="60" height="15" border="0" alt="got it" name="gotit"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
