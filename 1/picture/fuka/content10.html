Some people&#146;s ideas of scientific photography is just arty design,         something pretty. That was not the idea. The idea was to interpret science         sensibly, with good proportion, good balance and good lighting, so we         could understand it.</p>      <p>(<i>Berenice Abbott American Photographer</i>, Hank O&#146;Neal, 1982)</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="3">       <p>Berenice Abbott&#146;s attraction to facts and information in all of         their glory, as well as her interest in the science of photography, made         the subject of science a natural choice. According to Abbott, photography         was &quot;the medium preeminently qualified to unite art with science.         Photography was born in the years which ushered in the scientific age,         an offspring of both science and art.&quot; (Berenice Abbott, <i>Art in         America</i>, Winter 1959) For her <i><b>Beams of Light Through Glass</b></i>         photograph, she explained:</p>      <blockquote>         <p>Multiple beams of light from a source change direction when they go           into a glass plate and when they emerge. Some waves are reflected inside           the glass and then escape. The prism photograph was done very carefully.           The prism was filled with water and not one drop of air was inside.           The box that held the light source was specially designed and purposely           looks as it does to make for a better composition.</p>        <p>(Berenice Abbott in Berenice Abbott American Photographer, Hank O&#146;Neal,           1982)</p>      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="193">&nbsp;</td>    <td align="right" width="143"><a href="frame09.html" target="_top"><img src="../images_common/back.jpg" width="13" height="11" alt="Previous Page" border="0"></a>10       of 10</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
