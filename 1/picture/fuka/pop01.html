But New     York is the only city in the world rich enough in money, vitality, and men     to build itself anew . . . the only city sufficiently wealthy to be modern.</p>  <p align="right">- Bernard Fey, The American Experiment, 1929</p></blockquote><p>The big event in 1929 New York was the October stock market crash that began   the Great Depression. But Berenice Abbott arrived in New York before the crash,   just in time to witness the birth of the New York skyscraper. The Chrysler building   was finished in 1929, with the Empire State building and Rockefeller Center   not far behind. No one in Europe had seen anything like them, these spiked towering   symbols of modernism. Europe was old, New York was new, built by daring construction   workers including Mohawk men hired for their strength, skill and fearlessness   at heights that would leave most others dizzy and gasping.</p><p>Skyscrapers weren't the only modern thing happening in New York. The Museum   of Modern Art opened its doors in 1929. Prohibition was in effect, but that   didn't stop &quot;flappers&quot; those modern, sassy young women in short dresses   who smoked cigarettes and drank liquor in public. Modern sound took the form   of jazz, created by such greats as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Jelly   Roll Morton. They produced what many consider to be America's greatest gift   to music.</p><p>The Jazz Age in New York owed its beginnings to the fact that the Harlem Renaissance   was in full swing in 1929. Throughout the 1920s men and women from all over   the country came together in Harlem to form a black social and intellectual   movement of terrific energy. Poets, writers, artists, dancers, playwrights,   actors, photographers, musicians and more reaped the benefits of the thriving   cultural center that was Harlem. </p><p>At the second annual Academy awards in 1929 Best Picture was <i>The Broadway   Melody</i>. It was MGM's first full-length musical feature, advertised as &quot;all-talking,   all-singing, all dancing,&quot; with memorable hits like &quot;Give My Regards   to Broadway.&quot; It was not surpriseing that a movie about Broadway received   top honors. In 1929, New Yorkers went to plays on Broadway the way people go   to movies today. In 1928, the year before Berenice Abbott arrived in New York,   264 productions opened on Broadway.</p><p>Also new in 1929 &#150; car radios and experiments on electronic color television.   In 1929 Babe Ruth held the American League record for home runs. Berenice Abbott   couldn&#146;t fly to New York from Paris, but for the first time she could telephone   New York from aboard her ship while crossing the Atlantic.</p></body></html>
