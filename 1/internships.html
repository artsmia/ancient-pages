I have a lot of responsibilities 	here that I wouldn't have elsewhere, such as making important decisions 	about the reinstallation of the African Art Gallery. In addition to learning 	from and working with the very knowledgeable staff, I get to handle objects, 	and write label text that will eventually be read by the public. Here, 	I don't feel like &quot;just an intern,&quot; but like I have a real job 	that means something and is important to the whole museum.&quot;</p>      <p align="RIGHT">Kyan Celise Thornton<br>                                                        	Curatorial Intern,<br>	Africa, Oceania,<br>                     	and the Americas</p>      <hr>      <P>Internships may range from one to twelve months in length, with a minimum 	time commitment of twenty hours per week expected. Intern positions are 	typically project-oriented within a specific department. A frequent classroom 	component acquaints interns with various functions, programs, departments, 	and staff of the museum and/or relate to the intern experience. Students 	often arrange academic credit for their experience through their college 	or university.</P>      <P>The availability of internships is determined by the needs of individual 	departments throughout the year, within the limitations of staff and space 	availability, exhibition schedules and the varying potential for challenging 	intern projects. Candidates may consider internships in several areas 	of the museum, including the Curatorial, Education, Marketing and Communications, 	and Development Divisions. </P>      <P>Interns are placed three times each year. The application deadlines are 	the first of October(winter/spring internships), March(summer internships), 	and June(fall/winter internships).
