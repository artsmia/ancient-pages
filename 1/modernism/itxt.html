It is the name   given to the art school founded by Gropius under the original title of the Staatliches   Bauhaus Weimar. The Bauhaus, which lasted from 1919-1933, has come to represent   the distillation of the Modern movement and the fundamentalist design ethic.   Yet, its intellectual origins lay with t he Arts and Crafts movement and its   early years (before Gropius moved the school to his designed building in Dessau   where it become known simple as the Bauhaus) were dominated by Expressionist   arts, thought and behavior. Under Gropius the Bauhaus became an art school of   immense creativity and influence. The approach to design was to stress aesthetic   fundamentals and strive for geometrically pure forms, but unlike the practitioners   of the Arts and Crafts movement, machines were not disdained. Some of the greatest   painters, graphic designers, architect/designers and thinkers of the period   participated in the movement. </font></p></body></html>
