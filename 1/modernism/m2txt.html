In America, the step-back skyscraper, the rich interiors of Donald Deskey and the modern-age, mass-produced vision of Kem Weber, Norman Bel Geddes and Walter Dorwin Teague pushed design into the realm of tomorrow. Over a 70-year period, Modernism's motivating spirit passed from reactionary to visionary. </font> </body></html>
