Voysey) espoused joy of labor and a return to simplified, honest forms. Stylized motifs, refined surfaces and proto-Art Nouveau lines were admirably realized in the work of Charles Robert Ashbee and Archibald Knox who eventually abandoned all stylistic imitations to forge a new design vocabulary. </font></body></html>
