Inheriting the great traditions of French color   and form, fed further by Europe's craze for Japonisme, this turn-of-the-century   style replaced a dependency on historical design formulae with organic form   derived largely from nature. Familiar motifs included curvilinear elements,   sinuous contours, of tendrils and floral arabesques, whiplash lines, and later,   exaggerated embellishment. Art Nouveau responded well to inlaid wood veneers,   wrought iron and glass. The name derives from a Paris gallery; L'Art Nouveau   opened in 1895 by Siegfried Bing. In Italy it was called Stile Liberty of Stile   Floreale; in Germany, Jugendstil (youth style). It reached its highpoint in   the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. While it tried nobly to reconcile art   and industry, it was essentially an artist's style and failed to satisfy the   demands of mass production. </font></p></body></html>
