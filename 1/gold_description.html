Rapson's         designs contributed to the evolution of modern style which began in the         late 1930s and gained momentum in the years following World War II. The         MIA's installation focuses on Rapson's numerous residential design projects,         many of which are located in the Twin Cities. The Weisman Art Museum will         feature Rapson's public commissions such as the Guthrie Theatre and the         urban planning project Cedar-Riverside. Combined, the two installations         contain over 250 architectural elements, models, furniture, photographs         and drawings, many on display for the first time.       <p> At The MIA, an introductory gallery will be devoted to his many designs         for furniture and decorative arts. The MIA will recreate a portion of         Rapson's modern design shop, Rapson, Inc., which he ran in Boston around         1950 with his wife, Mary. This section will also display Rapson's lively         designs for tableware, flatware, jewelry and furniture. Subsequent sections         of the exhibition will feature groups of Rapson's important experimental         house designs, such as his Cave House (1938) and his Greenbelt House (1945),         which will highlight his use of unconventional spaces and his lively design         process.       <p>Of Rapson's later residential commissions, the most well-known is the         Philip W. Pillsbury House, built in 1963 on Lake Minnetonka for the president         of the Pillsbury Company. Because the house was demolished in 1997, it         only exists in drawings, photographs, architectural elements and in a         virtual tour on CD- ROM produced at the time of demolition. Visitors to         the MIA will experience a three-dimensional display about the house, which         is considered one of Rapson's finest homes.       <p> Rapson began making his major contributions to modernism in the late         1930s and early 1940s during a period of study and work with Eliel Saarinen         at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. He entered housing competitions         sponsored by publishers and manufacturers in which his designs promoted         creative, affordable housing for the middle class which maximized space,         light and play areas. Many of his entries, such as the "Greenbelt House"         (1945) were efficient yet provided a sense of luxury and connection to         the outdoors through patios, an interior green space and large expanses         of glass.       <p>While head of the Department of Architecture at the Institute of Design         in Chicago, Rapson collaborated with former Bauhaus designer L&aacute;szl&oacute;         Moholy- Nagy on trade installations and new interiors for B&O Railroad         passenger cars and with H.G. Knoll Associates on furniture designs. His         involvement with Knoll eventually led to his designing the U.S. Embassy         buildings in France, Denmark and Sweden.       <p>During his thirty-year career as professor and head of the School of         Architecture at the University of Minnesota (1954-1984), Rapson designed         several nationally-significant examples of modern architecture. Among         the most notable are the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, the Philip         W. Pillsbury Residence in Wayzata, Minnesota, and the award-winning Performing         Arts Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Rapson is also         responsible for the design of over 50 residences, numerous churches and         several public buildings in Minneapolis. His commitment to better housing         for city dwellers of all backgrounds led to the Cedar-Riverside project         in Minneapolis, the first "New-Town-In-Town" sponsored by the U.S. Government's         Department of Housing and Urban Development.     </td>  </tr></table><table border="0" width="450" align="center">  <tr bgcolor="#999999" align="center" bordercolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#000000" bordercolordark="#000000">     <td><b><font color="#660000">About This Exhibit</font></b></td>    <td><b><a href="exhibits/rapson_events.html">Ralph Rapson Events</a></b></td>    <td><b><a href="exhibits/rapson_gallery.html">Photo Gallery</a></b></td>    <td><b><a href="exhibits/intro.html">Other Exhibits</a></b></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
