This year's offering is a handblown Chihuly Buttercup Yellow Persian with Red Lip Wrap. The Persian, approximately 9 x 13 x 10 inches, will be shipped in its own Plexiglas vitrine. The definitive volume on the series, autographed by the artist, will be sent to edition purchasers later this fall.<P>According to Chihuly, the Persian series started out as "a search for forms. I hired Martin Blank in 1985, just our of R.I.S.D., and I saw right away that he was very talented and creative. He wasn't concerned as much with craftsmanship as he was with experimenting, so I immediately set him and Robbie Miller up in a corner of the hotshop at Pilchuck while the big team...was working on large Macchia. I would make large pencil drawings for Martin and Robbie with a couple of dozen small forms and then I would put an X under the ones I wanted them to go for."<P>From those early densely colored forms, the series expanded to include multipart sets in colors spanning a huge range, including lavender, cobalt blue, leaf green, cadmium red, and yellow. The Persians expanded in size as well (some are more than 3 feet in diamete). The quintessential Persian, like this special edition, is a flowerlike form resting on a ball foot, with gently fluted edges and fine lines that spiral around the body. It will make a beautiful addition to any collection of fine art.<P>Each Buttercup Yellow Persian with Red Lip Wrap is individually blown and so no two are exaclty alike. The price is $2,600 (which includes shipping).</tr></table></body></HTML>
