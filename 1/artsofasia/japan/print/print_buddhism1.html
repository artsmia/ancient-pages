It spread throughout India...eastward into Southeast             Asia...and northward into China. In its wake were produced some of             the greatest monuments of religious art the world has ever known.             Buddhism was formally introduced to Japan nearly 1500 years ago by             diplomatic envoys from the nearby Korean peninsula. </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="150" height="100" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="right"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Based             on the premise that life is suffering and that suffering is caused             by earthly desires, Buddhism offered a means to achieve enlightenment             or nirvana. Nirvana is the cessation of human cravings, which bind             people to an endless cycle of birth and death. </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Of             the many factions of Buddhism, which came to flourish in Japan, the             one that brought comfort and inspiration to the broadest cross-section             of humanity was the worship of Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light.             Amida Buddha was only one of many Buddhist deities imported from the             Asian continent in the sixth century. In Japan, worship of Amida grew             progressively popular, reaching a golden age between the 10th and             13th centuries. Even today, followers of this gentle and compassionate             deity make up the greatest number of Buddhists in Japan. </font></p>          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div><div align="center"></div></body></html>
