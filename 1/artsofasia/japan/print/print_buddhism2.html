It is a mandala or diagram of             a portion of the Buddhist cosmos -in this case the Pure Land or Western             Paradise of Amida. The original mandala, imported from China, was             kept at the Taima temple. Because of this, such mandalas are often             referred to as Taima mandalas. Amida is shown beneath a jeweled canopy,             seated on a lotus throne. Like all celestial beings, he is rendered             in gold to suggest the light, which emanates from his body. Surrounded             by a heavenly host of bodhisattvas and musicians, Amida presides over             the palaces and gardens of his Western Paradise. In the foreground,             the souls of the faithful are shown being reborn on lotus blossoms,             which rise from the reflection pond. </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><img border="0" width="150" height="100" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="5" hspace="3" align="right">Paintings             such as these were intended to help believers visualize Amida's paradise.             By earnestly concentrating on Amida and his heavenly surroundings,             constantly invoking his name, followers could help insure their rebirth             in the Pure Land. There they would be free of all pain and suffering.             Their eyes would be dazzled by trees of jewels. Various birds and             musicians would create delightful music. </font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">             The air would be fragrant and the water in the rivers would run warm             or cool </font></p>          <p align="left"></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Of             the many factions of Buddhism, which came to flourish in Japan, the             one that brought comfort and inspiration to the broadest cross-section             of humanity was the worship of Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light.             Amida Buddha was only one of many Buddhist deities imported from the             Asian continent in the sixth century. In Japan, worship of Amida grew             progressively popular, reaching a golden age between the 10th and             13th centuries. Even today, followers of this gentle and compassionate             deity make up the greatest number of Buddhists in Japan. </font></p>          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div><div align="center"></div></body></html>
