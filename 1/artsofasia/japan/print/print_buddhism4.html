This type of imagery stems from Amida's             vow to personally appear at the moment of death, in order to insure             safe passage and rebirth of the soul in the Pure Land.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif"> In             this painting from the permanent collection, Amida is shown floating             downward from the clouds. He is accompanied by his attendant bodhisattvas:             Seishi, whose hands are clasped in prayer, and Kannon, who bears a             lotus upon which to receive the soul of the dying. Rays of light radiate             outward from Amida whose body has been rendered in gold to emphasize             his divinity. His robes, finely painted in thin, even lines, are delicately             patterned with cut gold foil known in Japanese as kirikane. The effect             is one of great luxury and ease, foreshadowing the splendors of Western             Paradise. Such a painting, hung by the bed, would have provided a             focus for the dying person, bringing considerable comfort and hope             in their final hours. So compelling was the concept of Amida coming             to welcome a soul at the moment of death, that several other deities             also came to be depicted descending from the heavens. The swirling             clouds beneath the figure indicate that it is also a "raigo", a heavenly             descent. </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">A             masterpiece of Japanese Buddhist sculpture from the 13th century,             here at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, represents the Bodhisattva             Jizo. Jizo was believed to come to the aid of people condemned to             the torments of hell. He also was popular protector of children and             pregnant women. In this small, exquisitely carved example, Jizo holds             a Buddhist wish-granting jewel in his left hand and a priest's staff             in his right.
