Created by artist Jocho in the 12th century,             every detail serves to suggest Amida's radiant calm and quiet serenity             as he presides over a beautiful pond surrounded by flowering plants             and trees.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif"> </font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="right"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Based             on the precedent set by Jocho in the 12th century, later sculptors             created similar images of Amida. The Amida in the collection of the             Institute of Arts, originally covered with gold, still conveys the             over-riding benevolence of this deity. The face is full and untroubled,             with dreamy, nearly closed eyes suggesting Amida's serene, introspective             nature. This effect is heightened by the shallowly carved folds of             the robe falling softly across the shoulder and over the lap. Amida's             hands are held in one of many symbolic gestures known as Mudra. His             right hand dispels fears while his left is held in a gesture of giving.             The overall effect is one of reassuring calm and quietude and undoubtedly             provided worshippers with a sense of great comfort. </font></p>          <p align="left"></p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div><div align="center"></div></body></html>
