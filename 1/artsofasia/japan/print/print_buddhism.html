It spread throughout India...eastward into Southeast           Asia...and northward into China. In its wake were produced some of the           greatest monuments of religious art the world has ever known. Buddhism           was formally introduced to Japan nearly 1500 years ago by diplomatic           envoys from the nearby Korean peninsula. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="150" height="100" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="right"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Based           on the premise that life is suffering and that suffering is caused by           earthly desires, Buddhism offered a means to achieve enlightenment or           nirvana. Nirvana is the cessation of human cravings, which bind people           to an endless cycle of birth and death. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Of the           many factions of Buddhism, which came to flourish in Japan, the one           that brought comfort and inspiration to the broadest cross-section of           humanity was the worship of Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light. Amida           Buddha was only one of many Buddhist deities imported from the Asian           continent in the sixth century. In Japan, worship of Amida grew progressively           popular, reaching a golden age between the 10th and 13th centuries.           Even today, followers of this gentle and compassionate deity make up           the greatest number of Buddhists in Japan. </font><br>        </p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">According           to ancient Buddhist scriptures, in eons past Amida vowed to create a           paradise where people could strive toward enlightenment without the           pain and suffering associated with life on Earth. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">This           image of Amida's paradise from the museum's collection was painted in           Japan early in the 14th century. It is a mandala or diagram of a portion           of the Buddhist cosmos -in this case the Pure Land or Western Paradise           of Amida. The original mandala, imported from China, was kept at the           Taima temple. Because of this, such mandalas are often referred to as           Taima mandalas. Amida is shown beneath a jeweled canopy, seated on a           lotus throne. Like all celestial beings, he is rendered in gold to suggest           the light, which emanates from his body. Surrounded by a heavenly host           of bodhisattvas and musicians, Amida presides over the palaces and gardens           of his Western Paradise. In the foreground, the souls of the faithful           are shown being reborn on lotus blossoms, which rise from the reflection           pond. </font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"></font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="150" height="100" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="right"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Paintings           such as these were intended to help believers visualize Amida's paradise.           By earnestly concentrating on Amida and his heavenly surroundings, constantly           invoking his name, followers could help insure their rebirth in the           Pure Land. There they would be free of all pain and suffering. Their           eyes would be dazzled by trees of jewels. Various birds and musicians           would create delightful music. The air would be fragrant and the water           in the rivers would run warm or cool according to each person's desires.           In such a place without pain or want, the faithful could devote themselves           fully to achieving enlightenment. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="150" height="100" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">During           the 11th century in Japan, when belief in Amida reached a high point,           Japanese noblemen actually tried to recreate Amida's paradise on Earth.           Built in 1053 by Fujiwara Yorimichi, a high-ranking nobleman, the Hoodo           or Phoenix Hall of the Byodo-in temple closely resembles the Institutes           painting of the Pure Land.</font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Seated           within the elegant, palace-like pavilion, an image of Amida shimmers           with a layer of gold. Created by artist Jocho in the 12th century, every           detail serves to suggest Amida's radiant calm and quiet serenity as           he presides over a beautiful pond surrounded by flowering plants and           trees.</font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif"> </font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="right"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Based           on the precedent set by Jocho in the 12th century, later sculptors created           similar images of Amida. The Amida in the collection of the Institute           of Arts, originally covered with gold, still conveys the over-riding           benevolence of this deity. The face is full and untroubled, with dreamy,           nearly closed eyes suggesting Amida's serene, introspective nature.           This effect is heightened by the shallowly carved folds of the robe           falling softly across the shoulder and over the lap. Amida's hands are           held in one of many symbolic gestures known as Mudra. His right hand           dispels fears while his left is held in a gesture of giving. The overall           effect is one of reassuring calm and quietude and undoubtedly provided           worshippers with a sense of great comfort. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></a></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Another           aspect of Amida's boundless compassion is known as "raigo" or the "welcoming           descent of Amida". This type of imagery stems from Amida's vow to personally           appear at the moment of death, in order to insure safe passage and rebirth           of the soul in the Pure Land.</font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif"> In this           painting from the permanent collection, Amida is shown floating downward           from the clouds. He is accompanied by his attendant bodhisattvas: Seishi,           whose hands are clasped in prayer, and Kannon, who bears a lotus upon           which to receive the soul of the dying. Rays of light radiate outward           from Amida whose body has been rendered in gold to emphasize his divinity.           His robes, finely painted in thin, even lines, are delicately patterned           with cut gold foil known in Japanese as kirikane. The effect is one           of great luxury and ease, foreshadowing the splendors of Western Paradise.           Such a painting, hung by the bed, would have provided a focus for the           dying person, bringing considerable comfort and hope in their final           hours. So compelling was the concept of Amida coming to welcome a soul           at the moment of death, that several other deities also came to be depicted           descending from the heavens. The swirling clouds beneath the figure           indicate that it is also a "raigo", a heavenly descent. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"></font><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">A           masterpiece of Japanese Buddhist sculpture from the 13th century, here           at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, represents the Bodhisattva Jizo.           Jizo was believed to come to the aid of people condemned to the torments           of hell. He also was popular protector of children and pregnant women.           In this small, exquisitely carved example, Jizo holds a Buddhist wish-granting           jewel in his left hand and a priest's staff in his right. Although he           wears the patchwork robes of a monk, they are richly patterned with           cut gold to suggest the sumptuous texture of richly woven silk. </font></p>        <p align="center"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif" size="3"><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10"></a><a href="http://wwwartsmia.org"><img border="0" width="100" height="150" src="../images/fakeimg.gif" vspace="0" hspace="10"></a></font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">Such           works of art were compelling reminders of the gentle and compassionate           nature of Buddhism. Each peaceful expression, suggesting enlightenment,           brought hope and encouragement to all who longed for the blissful release           of nirvana. </font></p>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><a href="../transcripts/script_buddhism.html"><font face="Skia, Times, Times New Roman, serif">http://www.artsmia.org/artsofasia/japan/</font></a></p>      </div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
