Born in Harlem in 1919,       De Carava transformed images of everyday life into emblems and metaphors       of the world he observed. The exhibition captures the wide variety of subjects       he addressed over the years, from intimate still-lifes to portraits of jazz       musicians to poignant reflections of the panorama of daily human life, some       of which subtly address the injustices of racial discrimination.       <p> Influenced by his older contemporaries in the Harlem art community such         as Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, and Charles White, De Carava shared         their interest and concern with African American life and history. Although         trained as a painter and printmaker, De Carava embraced photography as         his primary medium in the late 1940s, and went on to establish and define         a new aesthetic in American photography.       <p> This exhibition, organized by The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and         its accompanying publication, were supported by a grant from Metropolitan         Life Foundation. Additional funding was provided by Agnes Gund and Daniel         Shapiro, and the National Endowments for the Arts.       <p align="right"><a href="exhibits/decarava_events_temp.html">Information         about the events accompanying this exhibit can be found online.</a>     </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>Ralph Rapson: Sixty Years of Modern Design </b><br>      March 28 - July 25, 1999 <br>      U.

The portraits represent an         optimistic side of Gaard, who considers them, "Monuments to both life         as identity and to the humility of representation."       <p>For two decades, Gaard's reputation was linked to Artpolice, the underground         grafix collective magazine that he created and guided, and to a body of         work that depicted nightmarish, sexually explicit images. He is also well-known         for his provocative writing and criticism and for his honest discussion         of manic- depression, an illness that has informed both the content and         construction of his work.       <p>Born in 1948, Frank Gaard earned a B.F.A. degree from the school of the         Art Institute of Chicago in 1967 and an M.F.A. from the California College         of Arts and Crafts in 1968. He served as a professor of fine arts at the         Minneapolis College of Art and Design from 1969 to 1987. Gaard has exhibited         his work regionally, nationally and internationally.     </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>Francis Bacon: A Retrospective Exhibition </b><br>      April 11 - May 30, 1999 <br>      Dayton Hudson Gallery (admission to be charged) </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> Organized by The Trust for Museum Exhibitions       <p> This retrospective will include about 60 of Bacon's finest and most         significant oil paintings, including a number of the famous triptychs.         The exhibition aims to demonstrate the many facets of Bacon's imagery:         the Crucifixion themes; the screaming popes inspired by Vel&aacute;zquez's         Portrait of Innocent X; the studies of the human body developed from Bacon's         fascination with Eadweard Muybridge's pioneering action photographs of         the 1880s, and with the cinema of the 1920s; the Van Gogh series; portraits,         animals, and at least one of his enigmatic landscapes.     </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>Helmut Stern Collection of Central African Art </b><br>      September 18, 1999- ongoing<br>      Central African Gallery </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> Description to follow. </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>David Parker/Lewis Hines </b><br>      May 22 - September 5, 1999 <br>      Harrison Photography Gallery </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> Description to follow. </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>Recent Accessions </b><br>      June 12 - October 3, 1999 <br>      Cargill Gallery </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> Description to follow. </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> <b>Chagall</b> (working title) <br>      August 28 - October 24, 1999 <br>      U.
