      <h3>ArtsExplorer: Now you can take your own audio tours of the Institute's 
        highlights. </h3>
      <p>The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is introducing its self-guided audio 
        tours of the museum's permanent collection called "ArtsExplorer". You 
        may be familiar with this kind of tour from visits to other major museums. 
        Visitors rent a recorded narration with a portable CD player and headphones 
        and take a private tour of museum treasures at their own pace. The Institute 
        is working with Antenna Audio Inc. to produce the tours, using the company's 
        user-friendly technology. Antenna is the international company that produces 
        audio tours for the Louvre, the Vatican Museums, the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
        and the National Gallery of Art-London, and other museums, national parks 
        and galleries. The ArtsExplorer program tells visitors the exciting stories 
        behind the major works in the collection. The Institute's curators discuss 
        their research on objects in the collection in personal interviews. This 
        is information beyond what you'll find on the gallery wall labels, and 
        is enhanced by music and sound effects. The first ArtsExplorer tour covers 
        one hundred of the museum's masterpieces. Narration about more works of 
        art will be added throughout the year. Icons in the galleries will identify 
        which objects are described on the tour. ArtsExplorer's interactive CD 
        technology allows visitors to listen to commentary only about the works 
        they choose, in any order&#151;and to hear as many items as they wish. 
        This gives the visitor much more control than a cassette tour would. Try 
        ArtsExplorer during your next visit to the Institute and experience the 
        museum in a whole new way. 
      <p> The ArtsExplorer audio tour program can be rented directly within the 
        Third Avenue or 24th Street Museum entrances $3 for Members and Senior 
        citizens $4 for Nonmembers
