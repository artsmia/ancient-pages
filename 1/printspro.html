Due to light sensitivity and the sheer enormity of the collection         itself (at least 45,000), these delicate objects are frequently rotated,         resulting in brief, brilliant appearances.<BR>        <BR>        In the interest of creating wider access, the Herschel V. Jones Print         Study Room affords scholars, students and the general public an opportunity         to schedule appointments to view works, which can be pulled from their         climate-controlled storage upon request.<BR>        <BR>        Starting this fall, visitors have yet another point of entry into this         remarkable collection -through a select group of forty-eight prints, personally         chosen and interpreted by the curator- in the form of a touch-screen computer         program installed amid the museum's galleries.<BR>        <BR>        More at home with 17th-century masters than late 20th-century technology,         Campbell allowed the Institute's Interactive Media Group (IMG) the freedom         to explore new ways of presenting these works in Prints &amp; Processes,         the seventh permanent-collection-based multimedia program to be produced         by the Institute.<BR>        <BR>        Campbell selected works that, taken together, introduce the story of print         development in the western world, dating back to the 15th century. Curatorial         Assistant Lisa Michaux and writer Julie L'Enfant elucidated Campbell's         concepts, shaping them for the interactive medium and the broad museum         audience.<BR>        <BR>        <IMG SRC="GIF/prints_process/doublelitho.jpg" WIDTH=200         HEIGHT=150 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=right>As the title implies, a balance was sought between the presentation         of great works from the collection and technical information shedding         light on fine art printmaking processes. Woodcuts, etchings, engravings,         lithographs and screenprints are exquisitely represented -in works by         Durer, Rembrandt, Kollwitz, Munch and Warhol, to name just a few- as the         processes behind print creation are demonstrated by living artists.<BR>        <BR>        Encouraging both looking and learning, the program allows swift movement         between two primary print environments: the pristine space where works         on paper are displayed and studied, and the gritty studio in which they         are produced.<BR>        <BR>        <IMG SRC="GIF/prints_process/a_eprints.jpg" WIDTH=200         HEIGHT=150 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=left>The forty-eight selected works appear as stacks of matted         prints organized by medium and can be paged through chronologically or         selected from a list. Narrated comments illuminate these prints, imparting         historical, aesthetic and technical information. Visual highlighting directs         the viewer's eye, reinforcing the commentary. Visitors can also choose         to enlarge each print beyond the perimeter of the computer screen to examine         details and study technique.<BR>        <BR>        To constitute the process half of the program, a simple, graphic image         of a tree was given to five printmakers with the instruction that they         each put this image through the paces of a specific print medium and that         they allow the steps of their creative process to be videotaped.<BR>        <BR>        <IMG SRC="GIF/prints_process/4prints.jpg" WIDTH=133         HEIGHT=150 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=right>The results include a group of print illustrations that show,         at once, a consistency of image and the essential differences between         the processes' respective natures. These illustrations became effective         icons, leading the program's users through it's clean, straightforward         interface, realized by graphic designer Julie Loney. <IMG         SRC="GIF/prints_process/reliefroller.jpg" WIDTH=200         HEIGHT=150 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=left><BR>        <BR>        The video footage was edited into discreet, step-by-step segments by IMG         staffer Brian Thompson, who also handled programming. Recorded in their         printmaking studios, artist David Rathman demonstrates relief, Michael         Kareken and Fred Hagstrom employ engraving techniques, Philip Barber produces         a lithograph, and Ruthann Godollei a screenprint.<BR>        <BR>        As part of a museum-going experience, Prints &amp; Processes offers concepts         and information that can be applied to the museum's ever-changing display         of works on paper. The program is also soon to be published on CD-ROM,         allowing access anytime to students, educators, collectors and anyone         with an interest in the fine art of printmaking.<BR>        <BR>        Location: <A HREF="perm_coll_no_java/prints_drawings.html">Prints and         Drawings</A>, 3rd floor</P>      <P>      <P>      <P>      <P><a href="img1.html" target="_top"><img src="GIF/img.gif" width="164" height="27" border="0" alt="Interactive Media Group Menu"></a>     </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
