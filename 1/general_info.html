        <P><A NAME="history"></A><B>Our History</B><BR>
          The Minneapolis Institute of Arts was established in 1883. The museum 
          building, designed by the firm of McKim, Mead and White, opened its 
          doors in 1915. In 1974 the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange was commissioned 
          to design needed additions to the neoclassical structure. In the 1990s, 
          with funds from the New Beginnings Campaign, the museum was renovated, 
          the collections reinstalled, and state of the art technology introduced 
          to help visitors and members interpret the works of art.</P>

          The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is dedicated to national leadership
