More than 1700 artists were         represented in the gallery exhibition and in the corresponding online         exhibition.

The MAEP's objectives are to exhibit Minnesota artists' work         on a regular basis; to foster the exchange of ideas among artists; to         stimulate interaction of ideas among artists, the museums, and the public;         and to facilitate the creation and presentation of work in a context that         is not inhibited by aesthetic fashion or commercial demand. Designed to         respond to the perceptions and evaluation of artists, the Program is directed         by a panel of seven artists elected for two-year terms by Minnesota's         artist community. The panel and the Institute are linked by a jointly         selected Program Coordinator who is employed by the museum at a rank equal         to that of a curator. The Program Coordinator implements policy and is         responsible for exhibition planning and installation and the administrative         and fiscal management of the Program. The Coordinator and MAEP staff develop         exhibition-related projects and public programs and oversee the production         of exhibition-related publications.         <p> The creation of quality exhibitions continues to be the first priority           of the Program. Since 1975 the MAEP has presented over 130 exhibitions           of contemporary art. Projects that generate interaction among artists,           the museum, and the public often result in collaborations with other           arts organizations (for example, the Asian American Renaissance and           the Minnesota Music Academy). The MAEP has collaborated with exhibiting           artists on a variety of publications since 1977.        <p> For 24 years the MAEP has provided this region with a unique model           for the production and presentation of work by contemporary and emerging           artists within the context of a major museum. Since its inception, the           program has supported exceptional aesthetic investigation and encouraged           the development of a diverse artist community. It has often provided           the first and earliest showings of work by artists who have gone on           to critical and commercial success. MAEP exhibitions have also explored           a wide range of topics, artistic styles, and political viewpoints and           have featured solo and group shows, career retrospectives, theme shows,           and large invitational projects of immense vitality and variety.        <p> All artists who live and work in Minnesota are welcome to participate           in the MAEP by attending the Program's Annual Meeting; taking part in           the election of Artist Panel members; submitting exhibition proposals           for panel review; and submitting slides and related materials to the           Program's slide reference and resource library, which has professional           profiles on more that 700 Minnesota artists.        <p> Artists who exhibit through the MAEP benefit from the museum's diverse           audience (1998-99 attendance was more than 500,301) and access to the           museum's professional support services. Exhibiting artists participate           at every level of exhibition planning and implementation. In all cases,           artists are involved with budget allocation and disbursement of honoraria           for the exhibition of their work and exhibition-related programming.           Artists have been paid honoraria for their involvement with public programs           and publications since 1975; exhibition honoraria have been paid since           1979.        </font></blockquote>      <hr>      <br>      <p><b> <a href="maep.html">Background</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="maep_how.html">How         MAEP Works</a> </b></p>      <br>    </font></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
