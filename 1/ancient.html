You make your way to         the Ancient Art galleries, where you visit your favorite         objects--the magnificent Roman marble copy of Polykleitos'         Doryphoros, the Greek Crouching Lion, the Assyrian Winged         Genius, the Egyptian Model Boat.<BR>                  <BR>                  But now, situated near these familiar treasures, you see         something new -the sixth of The Institute's interactive         multimedia programs, Ancient Art of the Mediterranean. Here         too, you find a gallery...on a computer screen. Situated         chronologically around a three-dimensional, open air,         rotunda-like space, you see 38 objects from the museum's         permanent collection.<BR>                  <BR>                  <IMG SRC="GIF/lion125.gif" ALT="Detail of the Lion"         WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=125 X-SAS-UseImageWidth         X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=right>Through a complex         combination of techniques, <B>photographic images of these         works have been seamlessly blended with intricately         designed, computer-rendered surroundings</B>. The         chronologically based layout, together with the architecture         of this virtual gallery, underscores the historical         succession of Mediterranean cultures, from Egypt to Greece         to Rome.<BR>                  <BR>                  Touch the screen and you find this simulated space is fully         navigable. Walk right up to the False Door, the Striding         Figure, or the Etruscan Cinerary Chest.<BR>                  <BR>                  <IMG SRC="GIF/birdseye125.gif"         ALT="Bird's-eye view of the objects" WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=125         X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>A         <B>bird's-eye view</B> lets you see the floorplan from above         and jump to any object in the space.

Ancient Art of the Mediterranean         and the five other interactive programs already installed throughout the         museum are made possible through the generous support of the General Mills         Foundation.      <P><a href="img1.html" target="_top"><img src="GIF/img.gif" width="164" height="27" border="0" alt="Interactive Media Group Menu"></a>         <BR>      <hr>      <i>Send comments to the <a href="mailto:wlee@artsmia.org">webmaster.</a>       </i>       <P>&nbsp;     </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
