This is a very special day         when so many of us have come together to celebrate and         witness the power of the democratic electoral process by         which we the people of Minneapolis have again chosen the         governmental leaders who will work to protect and advance         our municipality for the common good. All of us here this         morning are citizens; a collection of ordinary people who         reflect the growing and changing population of one of         America's finest cities. Through our presence, our caring,         commitment, and work for this city, each in our own way and         according to our means -- we all become players in the         continuing history of Minneapolis.</P>                  <P>We are evidence of the power of the democratic system in         America where so many of us from different religious,         ethnic, cultural, economic and historical backgrounds whose         families originally came from all areas of the world, have         come together with heartfelt commitment to build a community         through mutual efforts of human care. We all want to improve         our lives and environment so that we can make this an even         better city in which to live for our children and for future         generations.</P>                  <P>The mayor has asked me to speak about how the arts have         been and can continue to be a major element of the necessary         process of building understanding in an increasingly diverse         and complicated community environment. But before we assess         the present and look toward the future, as an historian I         would first like to briefly describe for you something of         the past -- what it was like here in the early years of this         area. Native oral tradition and archaeological evidence tell         us that this region was home to Native American peoples for         thousands of years. Their home-sites have long vanished but         their burial mounds which can still be seen are evidence of         communities of farmers, hunters and traders whose influence         extended for thousands of miles along the Mississippi River         and its tributaries. Native American peoples continued to         thrive here and 400 years ago the area was dominated by two         major ethnic groups -- the Dakota and the Anishenabe, or         Chippewa peoples, whose descendants still are an important         part of our city. The Dakota and Anishenabe enjoyed a rich         cultural life and also produced the first civic councils,         laws, and communal organizations in this region. Certainly         their continuing legacy must be recognized in any historical         review of our city. Europeans first came to this great land         of rivers, lakes, forest and prairie in the 17th century and         by the 1820s Fort Snelling had been established as the         center of a growing population in settlements and farmsteads         along the natural highways of the Mississippi and Minnesota         Rivers.</P>                  <P>One hundred forty two years ago, in 1856, the new city of         Minneapolis was authorized by the state legislature and two         years later the approximately 2,000 citizens organized our         first town council. The first mayor of our city, Mr. Dorilus         Morrison, was elected nine years later, in 1867. The         descendants of Mayor Morrison still honor that Minnesota         tradition of civic and social responsibility. Our city grew         quickly and in 1872 when the two cities of Minneapolis and         St. Anthony were merged, the combined population had reached         about 25,000 people. The major industries that drove this         growth were saw milling and grist milling -- taking         advantage of the vast forests for lumber and the fertile         soil that abundantly produced wheat and other grains.</P>                  <P>As our city grew and prospered its citizens soon created         educational and cultural institutions believing them to be         an integral and necessary element of an established         community. Schools had been part of the earliest settlements         and our system of public education is still one of the most         important elements of our communal structure. The arts of         poetry and literature were integrated into their teaching         and when our first mayor was elected in 1867, we also opened         the Pence Opera House on the corner of Hennepin and         Washington Avenues which was a venue for traveling         performances of music and theater.</P>                  <P>As the 1880s brought ever increasing prosperity to         Minneapolis, its citizens began to establish more arts         institutions. Indeed, during the mid-19th century cities         across America were establishing new cultural and artistic         institutions based on the philosophical belief that the fine         arts are essential to the human condition -- they are         elevating, they make people more benevolent, more alive to         the beauties of nature and of higher values and truths. As         the popular 19th century American writer and orator Henry         Ward Beecher said, "There can never be too many libraries,         too many galleries of art, too many literary men, too much         culture." In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art was         established in 1869, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the         Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1876, and the Art         Institute of Chicago in 1882. These set the pace for the         building of similar cultural arts centers in cities         throughout the United States because Americans fervently         believed that the arts "tend to humanize, to educate and         refine a practical and laborious people."</P>                  <P>An editorial in the Minneapolis Tribune of December 3,         1882, echoed this feeling when it proclaimed that ". . .         industry without art is brutality . . . American life,         especially, needs the softening, refining and uplifting         ministry of an interest in art." About one month later on         the evening of January 31, 1883, a group of 14 men and 11         women formally established The Minneapolis Society of Fine         Arts, our first public arts institution, now known as The         Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In 1903 it was joined by the         Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, now known as the Minnesota         Orchestra, as the earliest of many arts organizations that         would develop and prosper here over the next 100 years,         making our city today one of the leading arts centers in the         Midwest and indeed in the nation. Because our population is         expanding and changing we must ask ourselves why are the         arts so important to the educational, cultural and civic         health and growth of our city and its people? As an art         historian I have learned that the arts have been and still         are a fundamental and vital element of all societies in         every part of the world throughout history. It is through         the arts of dance, music, song, poetry, literature, theater,         and the many forms of visual arts from personal adornment to         ceramics, textiles, sculpture, drawing, painting, and         architecture, that all human beings express the most         important values of their lives, the values that tie them to         the world of nature, to history and to each other. Through         the arts humans express the sacred elements of their         religion, their foundation myths and their civic ethics. The         arts express the most essential elements of humanity and,         therefore, through the arts we can better know ourselves and         can better understand others of different backgrounds.</P>                  <P>As the arts express the most powerful forces that hold         human societies together, so can they be one of the most         effective means of uniting American cities such as         Minneapolis which increasingly reflects a richly diverse         mixture of people from different national, ethnic, historic         and religious backgrounds. To effectively live and work         together we must build bonds of communication, understanding         and respect -- and the arts are the best way to achieve this         essential civic and ethical goal.</P>                  <P>So here we are today participating in this inauguration         131 years after our first mayoral election,. We're all         familiar with the term inauguration as the formal ceremony         that marks the beginning of the term of office of a         president, a mayor, or other high official -- but what is         its derivation? What was its original meaning and how can         that help us chart our future course as individuals and as a         community? The word inauguration has its earliest roots in         ancient Roman culture and the Latin word auguratio -- the         means of predicting the future by reading signs in nature.         In Roman times important official acts or civic enterprises         were always preceded by a special ceremony conducted by a         priest who would perform an augury -- the sacred ritual of         observing patterns in the flight of birds and then         interpreting them as keys to the future.</P>                  <P>If we are to chart the future of the arts as an important         element of the social, economic and cultural life of our         city, we must first make an augury of today's arts         organizations to see what may lie ahead as we seek to build         a stronger and more effectively united community working         together for the common good.</P>                  <P>People from across America admire Minneapolis for the         beauty of its urban environment; its great parks system; its         public educational resources, colleges, and our University         of Minnesota. We are known for our strong economic base led         by a large number of international corporations and a strong         social and cultural environment generously supported by our         individuals, corporations, foundations and government         entities including the State of Minnesota, Hennepin County         and our city. Minneapolis might only be the 15th largest         metropolitan area in the United States, but we can boast one         of the largest numbers of cultural arts organizations of any         city in the country. Our Minnesota State Arts Board prepared         the following statistics that tell the story of the very         strong state of the arts here in our city. There are now 59         nonprofit theaters in Minneapolis, such as the         internationally renown Guthrie Theatre and other national         leaders like the African-American led Penumbra Theatre, the         Illusion Theatre, Theatre de la Jeune Lune, the Jungle         Theatre, and the Children's Theatre Company. We are home to         many fine music groups led by the world famous Minnesota         Orchestra and such well known groups as the Plymouth Music         Series. We are served by three distinguished art museums --         The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, long recognized         throughout the world for its collections of art from all         continents and time periods and regarded as one of the top         10 art museums in the country; the Walker Art Center whose         presentations of contemporary art, film, dance and         performance have made it an international leader in         presenting today's changing art forms, and the Frederick R.         Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota, whose new         building and programs have attracted much deserved         attention. These are just some of the leaders of the 288         nonprofit arts organizations in our city. It is also         important to know that Minneapolis is home to over 2,000         practicing artists; men and women who have devoted their         lives to the creation and performance of the arts.</P>                  <P>Our cultural arts thrive in a much higher proportion than         in most other American cities because our citizens,         foundations and corporations are among the most generous         patrons anywhere in the country. When this is joined with         the support of our local governments we demonstrate a unique         sense of cultural commitment that provides our citizens and         our children with great opportunities to develop themselves         and learn about others. The State Arts Board estimates that         in 1997, arts programs in Minneapolis attracted about         4,220,000 people of which almost 1,100,000 were youth. We've         also shown that culture can be a financial resource for our         city. For example, in 1994 the estimated economic impact of         the arts to our state was $900 million and the direct         spending by state arts organizations was $244 million.</P>                  <P>Here in Minneapolis we have also carved a national         reputation for reaching out to all citizens so that the arts         are available to everyone without limiting participation         only to those who can afford to pay. The list of free         cultural arts programs is truly outstanding. For example,         The Minneapolis Institute of Arts offers all of its         galleries and many exhibitions free to the public. By next         August the museum will double the size of its galleries and         public spaces. New galleries, educational and outreach         programs, and school tours planned with community advisors         will be devoted to African and African American art, Asian         arts from China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, the Himalaya,         India, and the Pacific Islands. We are building more         galleries for European arts, American arts, and galleries         devoted to Native American arts. We will also feature         gallery programs that will teach us about Buddhism,         Hinduism, Islam and Judaism to join our collections of         Christian art from many countries and time periods -- all of         it free to everyone.</P>                  <P>The well known and popular sculpture garden presented by         the Walker Art Center and the Minneapolis Park and         Recreation Board is one of the hallmarks of Minneapolis and         is free to all. The Walker also has free access to their         innovative education programs for our city's school         students. The exhibitions and programs of the Weisman Museum         at the University of Minnesota are free to the public. Our         theaters, symphony and other music groups make many of their         programs available to students at no charge, and the Park         Board adds to our lives with free art programs, concerts,         theater and creative opportunities in parks across the city.         </P>                  <P>All of these efforts show that Minneapolis' cultural arts         organizations are not only world leaders in artistic         quality, but are also creating important initiatives that         are models for other arts institutions and communities         around the country. In fact, many effective arts and         education programs developed in Minneapolis have been funded         by the top national foundations and the National Endowment         for the Arts and the Humanities -- making Minneapolis a true         leader in developing top quality arts programs that attract         and involve broad and inclusive public audiences.</P>                  <P>In summation, our augury has shown that Minneapolis has         an abundance of high quality cultural arts institutions that         have prospered because of the involvement and support of a         large and ever broadening public audience. We Minneapolitans         point with pride to our vibrant arts community as one of the         principle factors of the much used phrase "quality of life"         that helps to make our city one of the most desirable urban         centers in the country.</P>                  <P>But what of the future? How must we plan to keep the arts         strong? How can we work together to utilize our great         cultural resources as a vital social and civic tool to help         us build a better future so that people of increasingly         different backgrounds can forge common bonds based on         principles of mutual respect. The arts can help us bridge         our cultural gaps. In many ways the arts express a timeless         language of human values and emotions that cross boundaries         of ethnicity and language to bring people together with         experiences we can all share. Generations of our citizens         have worked hard to develop these precious cultural         resources. Now I believe our future lies in making them a         more important part of our children's lives by more         effectively bringing the arts into our school curriculum --         by using the power of the arts to help build a better social         environment for our young citizens -- and by doing so also         increase their skills and chances for success.</P>                  <P>My thirty years of teaching and professional museum         service have shown me the extraordinary power of the arts to         teach us about the best and most fundamental values of human         cultures from around the world. The arts are truly our         greatest and most eloquent communicators of social value and         human understanding. Furthermore, many studies have proven         that the arts can also make a significant difference in our         school children's general academic achievement. Research         over the past 30 years indicates that the arts can have a         significant impact upon achievement because they; - allow         for and respond to learning strengths and differences -         (they) stimulate creativity and problem solving abilities -         (they) develop diverse modes of critical thinking - (the         arts) engage more students productively in the learning         process - (and) stimulate positive brain activity by         integrating neurological and cognitive functions.</P>                  <P>In schools with high-quality comprehensive arts education         programs, student and teacher absenteeism decreases,         achievement scores on standardized tests increase, and         self-images improve.</P>                  <P>These attributes describe, Arts for Academic Achievement,         a joint project of the Minneapolis Public Schools and the         Minnesota Center for Arts Education funded by a $3,200,000         challenge grant from the Walter Annenberg Foundation. The         project is working to make the arts a more fundamental and         integral part of our kindergarten through high school         program because by doing so we can make our students more         efficient learners and more productive citizens who can         better help themselves, as they learn to care for others.         When the two-to-one challenge has been met, our Minneapolis         Public Schools will have $10,000,000 to support teaching the         arts.</P>                  <P>A wonderful example of this type of innovative, fully         integrated arts curriculum is being implemented in a         beautiful new school in our Whittier Neighborhood. Like many         other schools in our system, this one has a highly diverse         student population. Indeed there are over 70 nationalities         represented in our public school system and 15% of these         students speak other than English as their primary language.         The Whittier program is ably led by principal Susan Poston         and her group of devoted teachers, who are developing one of         Minneapolis' most creative school programs. The new Whittier         Community School for the Arts is not only fully integrating         the arts into their regular daily curriculum, they are also         engaging in a broad partnership with neighborhood arts         organizations to create new and exciting opportunities for         their students. The school is actively working with local         arts organizations like The Minneapolis Institute of Arts,         the Plymouth Music Series, the Jungle Theatre and especially         our nationally famous Children's Theatre Company. For         example, each Whittier Community School for the Arts student         is taken on regular tours of the collections and exhibitions         at the Institute of Arts. In a very special program, each         student first attends plays at the Children's Theatre. Then,         Children's Theatre professionals visit the school each week         to help lead class discussions about the play they've just         seen so that its themes can be analyzed and integrated into         other school projects. The students and their families are         then invited back to see the play together. This experience         is followed by an opportunity for students, families,         teachers and theater staff to come together to discuss the         issues brought up by the play and how they can affect their         lives through questioning and positive change.</P>                  <P>This is just one of many model projects carried out by         our cultural institutions in cooperation with our public         schools that are attracting national attention for their         innovation and effectiveness. Most of the expenses are being         born by the arts organizations themselves with critical         funding by foundations, corporations, private citizens, the         State of Minnesota, Hennepin County, and the City of         Minneapolis.</P>                  <P>With such leadership the future looks bright, but for the         programs to truly succeed on a broad level we need to         increase support so that quality programs can continue to         serve our citizens and especially our school children in         their developing years.</P>                  <P>The arts are a vitally important part of our social,         cultural and economic well being. We've shown that they can         also be a most effective means of bringing together our         diverse population and of helping our children become better         students, better citizens, and better future achievers. As         we all work to build a more effective civic environment for         our great city, let's make sure that we continue the years         of hard work and progress that have made Minneapolis one of         the great cultural capitals of our nation. With the support         of our Mayor and our City Council, Minneapolis will continue         its great tradition of leadership and service in the arts as         a critical factor in our lives as individuals and as a         respectful and successful community.</P>                  <P>Thank you.      </TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
