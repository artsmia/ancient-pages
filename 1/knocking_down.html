A large community meeting room is nowavailable for public programs, including classes, lectures andmeetings. A Family Activity Center, in the beginning stages ofconstruction, will provide space for art activities and relaxationfor children and families after a stimulating visit to the museum.Also, in mid-September you can expect to see the completedreinstallation of the 20th century collections in the East Wing ofthe second floor, the Sculpture Court area, and an expanded space forthe Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program. And for your shoppingpleasure, the new museum store, Articles, is already operating in itsnew location with twice the space! We hope you enjoy these excitingchanges and that they will enhance your next museum visit.</P><P>Please call the Visitor and Member Center at (612) 870-3131 oremail <A HREF="mailto:miagen@artsMIA.org">miagen@artsMIA.org</A>before you visit the museum to find out detailed information aboutwhich areas (and works of art) are affected by construction activity.We apologize for any temporary inconvenience and we thank you foryour support.</P></BODY></HTML>
