Hill to a crowd of excited onlookers at the 1915 opening         ceremony for The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In the many decades since,         The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has surpassed even Hill's ambitious         mandate, setting the highest goals and continuing to build on its distinguished         cultural legacy with service to local, national, and international audiences.       </p>      <p>While outstanding leadership, state-of-the-art facilities, inspired educational         programming and innovative use of technology have contributed to the Institute's         ongoing vitality, the foundation of its strength lies in the quality of         its permanent collection of art. Nearly 100,000 works of art spanning         5,000 years of cultural history represent the creative achievements of         peoples from around the globe. </p>      <p>This book guides readers on a captivating tour of The Minneapolis Institute         of Arts' collection.
