      <EM>ArtSmart: A Partnership between The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and South High School  </EM><P>
ArtSmart is a class offered to South High School students by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  ArtSmart students attend class daily at the museum for gallery tours and seminars with the museum's volunteer and professional staff.  They learn about art history, aesthetics, art criticism, and the functions of an art museum.  Students keep daily journals and write essays about works of art, exhibitions, and special programs in the museum.  Ultimately, the students go into city schools to teach other students about art in the museum's collection.
