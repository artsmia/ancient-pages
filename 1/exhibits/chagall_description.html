It is also a fine example of how         the museum and its visitors benefit when works of art are loaned to other         institutions. All of the masterpieces that were loaned to the Institute         for this event are coming from either the Guggenheim Museum, the Philadelphia         Museum of Art or The Centre Georges Pompidou in exchange for loans made         to those museums in recent years. The Institute&#146;s own Chagall painting,         <i>Poet with Birds</i>, will also be displayed.      <p>Chagall&#146;s inspired printmaking skills can be seen in approximately         20 works on paper, all drawn from the Institute&#146;s collection, including         <i>Paravent</i>, a large four-panel color lithograph.</p>      <p>Exhibition support for <i>Chagall</i> is provided by the law firm of         Robins, Kaplan, Miller and Ciresi.</p>      <p>&nbsp;       <hr>      <div align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font> <a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other         Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font> </div>      <p>&nbsp;     </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
