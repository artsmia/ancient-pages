The first session, held at pARTs gallery, focuses on how the         camera works and the printing process. After learning what makes a picture         a portrait, class participants have their family portraits taken with         an antique 4x5 camera and then create their own portfolio of city portraits         in the surrounding neighborhood. In the second session, held at the MIA,         participants examine their developed portfolios, explore the special photography         exhibition, Roy DeCarava: Retrospective, and learn how to interpret their         own city portraits through the technique of photomontage.</p>      <p>Classes are held on two consecutive Sundays, first at pARTs, 711 West         Lake Street (612/824-5500), and then at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts         in classroom 112/113.
