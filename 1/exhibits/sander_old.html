Its roof is an ash and beeswax-coated boat, overturned           and held high by four strong timbers. From the roof, Sander suspends           365 resin-encased, smoked herring&#151;each representing a day of the           calendar year.</p>        <p>Beaverhouse comments on our calculated, often ruthless exploitation           of nature. Its form is built around a log frame of poplars felled by           beaver. Underneath it sit 70 government-issue file cabinets, each drawer           containing a beaver skull. The skulls were discovered at a remote woodland           site, where a long-ago trapper had tossed them.</p>        <p>Bathhouse is more hopeful in its suggestion that we can find our way           back. Under the structure&#146;s roof&#151;an aquarium containing live           fish&#151;is a chair standing in a small reflecting pool, which, to           the artist, signifies human consciousness. </p>      </blockquote>      <p>Frank Sander&#146;s work is made possible, in part, by the support of         the Duluth Art Institute. </p>      <p>Human Nature is presented by the Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program,         an artist-managed curatorial department of The Minneapolis Institute of         Arts. </p>      <h3><font color="#660000">Events</font></h3>      <blockquote>        <p><b>Opening reception </b><br>          Thursday, July 15, 7-9 p.m., free </p>        <p><b>Artist-led Tour</b><br>          Sunday, August 1, 3 p.m., free</p>      </blockquote>      <h3><font color="#660000">About the Artist</font></h3>      <p>Frank Sander was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1949. He studied architecture         at <br>        Hamburg&#146;s Fachhochschule fur Bauwesen and fine art at Hochschule         fur Bildende-Kunste. In 1978, he moved to the United States, where he         has lived in Duluth, Minnesota, since 1990. He is recognized throughout         the region for his environmentally sensitive public art. </p>      <p>Sander combines his skills in carpentry, architecture and fine art to         produce environmentally sensitive structures and sculpture. His commitment         to a healthy &quot;leasing&quot; of the Earth is apparent in virtually         everything he does, from designing passive solar homes to building the         prototype for a worm composting greenhouse. </p>      <hr>      <p align="right"><b><a href="intro.html"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         </font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;<a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0"></a>         <a href="intro.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font></b>       </p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
