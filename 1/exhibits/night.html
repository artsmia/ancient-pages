      <p> <b>December 15, 2000&#150;February 11, 2001</b><br>
        Minnesota Artists Gallery<br>
        Opening reception: December 14, 7&#150;9 p.m. </p>
      <p>This exhibition will feature nightscapes by photographer Chris Faust 
        and painter Mike Lynch, artists who for many years have produced work 
        that reveals the essence of the urban landscape. Diligent explorers of 
        the physical worlds, they are both drawn to places that seem to stretch 
        over time&#150;empty dock yards, railroad yards, industrial sites, architectural 
        landmarks, and myriad nighttime haunts. Chris Faust is well known for 
        panoramic black-and-white photographs of landscape, images often filled 
        with contradiction and the enduring tension between humans and nature. 
        A disciplined and masterful technician, Faust achieves lush tonal quality 
        through a process called compensation development, which he learned from 
        John Sexton, a student of Ansel Adams. Mike Lynch has been recognized 
        for decades as an artist whose oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings 
        display rare economy and sensitivity. He employs practices such as 19th-century 
        British watercolor technique, and has devoted himself to night scenes 
        since 1953, when he began painting in earnest.</p>
