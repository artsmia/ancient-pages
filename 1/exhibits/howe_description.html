      <p> John (Jack) Howe was Frank Lloyd Wright&#146;s talented chief draftsman 
        from 1935 until Wright&#146;s death in 1959. One of the first members 
        of Wright&#146;s Taliesin Fellowship, which was begun in 1932, Howe was 
        schooled in the principles of organic architecture. In Wright&#146;s studio, 
        he directed the activities of the drafting room and completed many of 
        Wright&#146;s presentation drawings. Howe moved to Minnesota in the mid-1960s, 
        where he ran his own architectural practice that focused, like Wright&#146;s, 
        on domestic architecture. This exhibition will comprise 75 to 100 drawings, 
        mainly from the collections of the Northwest Architectural Archives and 
        the University Libraries, University of Minnesota. The exhibition coincides 
        with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy&#146;s annual meeting, which was 
        held September 20&#150;24, 2000 in Minneapolis.</p>
