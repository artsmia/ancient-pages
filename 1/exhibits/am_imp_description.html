Following the example of James         McNeill Whistler, a generation of Americans studied abroad to absorb the         new palette and compositions that were modernizing painting. Landscapes,         figure and still life paintings by Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, Thomas         Dewing, Maria Oakey Dewing, William Merrit Chase, Mary Cassatt and Theodore         Robinson marked a distinct departure from academic styles. In Boston,         Edmund Tarbell, Frank Benson, Robert Reid and Frederick Carl Frieseke         developed a genteel version of Impressionism related to the culture of         that city. Artists such as Daniel Garber and Maurice Prendergast carried         Impressionism further toward Modernism by creating a new tapestry-like         effect in their landscapes and cityscapes. Taken together, these Impressionists         foretold a new internationalism and modern view of life as America approached         the twentieth century.</p>      <p> American Impressionism<i> is one of eight exhibitions in </i>Treasures         to Go<i>, from the Smithsonian American Art Museum, touring the nation         through 2002.</i></p>      <p><i> The Principal Financial Group is a proud partner in presenting these         treasures to the American people, and is providing additional support         for opening events at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.</i></p>      <p><i> Presentation at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is sponsored by         Dayton&#146;s Project Imagine.</i></p>      <p><i> Promotional support is being provided by Star Tribune.</i></p>      <div align="right"><b><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0"></a>         <a href="intro.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font></b>         <hr>        <div align="left"><i> <a href="/comments">Send us your comments.</a></i>         </div>      </div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
