The new religion intertwined traditional Native American beliefs         with Christianity and spawned a new artistic tradition. This exhibition         explores the ways the Native American Church has helped Native peoples         in developing and preserving their identity while assisting in their adjustment         to new social, cultural and economic circumstances. A wide range of artistic         techniques and media has evolved throughout the history of this religion         to produce a distinctive genre of Native American art. The traditional         expressive forms of beadwork, carving, metalsmithing and featherwork were         combined to produce exquisite fans, rattles, drumsticks, jewelry, ritual         staffs and other ceremonial objects used during the services of the Church.         An understanding of the emergence of forms provides insight into the changing         nature of American Indian life and art during the 20th century.</p>      <p><i>This exhibition has been organized by the Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa,         Oklahoma with support from the Phillips Petroleum Company, Founders and         Associates, Inc., and the State Arts Council of Oklahoma.</i></p>    <div align="right"><b><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0"></a>         <a href="intro.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font></b>        <hr>        <div align="left"><i> <a href="/comments">Send us your comments.</a></i>         </div>      </div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
