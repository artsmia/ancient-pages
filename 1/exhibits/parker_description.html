Hine turned his lens on the social, industrial         and human abuses associated with child labor. His images proved to be         so persuasive that they effectively helped to secure labor and safety         laws for all workers &#150;both children and adults&#151; in the United         States.      <p>Almost 75 years later, David L. Parker, a Minneapolis physician and artist,         took up the cause of photographing child laborers around the world. The         children he photographs work in a variety of environments &#150;from Central         America and North Africa to Turkey, India and Asia. His images are intended         to provoke questions about how and where children should be allowed to         work, what role global trade plays in the perpetuation of child labor         and whether the rights of children should rise above the sovereign rights         of nations.      <p>A symposium related to photography and social concerns is being planned         for September, 1999.
