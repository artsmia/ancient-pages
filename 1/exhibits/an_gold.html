Both beautiful and rare, the precious metal         is endowed with great value. Because gold is easily worked and virtually         indestructible, ancient goldsmiths transformed it skillfully into magnificent         jewelry. These splendid objects have survived to tell us about the artists         who created them and the people who wore and were buried with them.       <p>A collection of 105 superb pieces of gold jewelry, dating from the 7th         Century B.C. to the 3rd Century AD, will be displayed beginning November         21. The exhibition, Ancient Gold: Jewelry from the Dallas Museum of Art,         can be seen in the Dayton Hudson Gallery through March 7, 1999. Visitors         will discover bracelets, brooches, earrings, pendants, necklaces and rings         - all crafted from gold and many embellished with precious and semi-precious         stones, pate de verre and enamel.       <p>Assembled between the 1930s and the 1960s by Swiss collector, Dr. Athos         Moretti, the Dallas collection of Greek, Etruscan, Roman and Near Eastern         jewelry is unsurpassed in quality, style and workmanship. The sophisticated         aesthetic sense and technical mastery of ancient goldsmiths are evident         in the objects in this exhibition. Working only with basic tools, they         employed a wide variety of techniques, including repousse, stamping and         punching, granulation and filigree, that are still being used today. The         "miniature sculptures" created by these artists reflected the styles of         larger sculptures of the time. Because it was customary to bury gold ornaments         with the dead, many of them survived, making it possible to trace the         development of ancient jewelry styles in great detail.       <table border="0" align="right">        <tr>           <td><img src="../GIF/ag_snake.jpg" width="172" height="250"></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td align="center">             <table border="0">              <tr>                 <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Single                   Snake Armlet<br>                  Roman, 2nd Century B.C.<br>                  Gold<br>                  The Dallas Museum of Art</font></b></font></td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>In addition to ornaments displayed as signs of wealth and power, gold         jewelry was also used for religious, magical or symbolic reasons by ancient         people. Earring designs representing Aphrodite and Eros were worn to evoke         desire, lions were symbols of fertility and royal power, and snakes were         a form of protection. Some objects, such as the Etruscan fibulas or garment         fasteners, were both decorative and practical.       <p>The largest part of the collection is Greek in origin. The practice of         melting down and reusing gold from unwanted jewelry not withstanding,         a large amount of Greek jewelry has survived. It was found in graves and         sanctuaries, mostly in the area of the wealthy city-states of southern         Italy and Sicily that were settled by the Greeks as early as the 9th century         B.C.       <p>Among the oldest pieces in the exhibition are three spectacularly intricate         pieces - two bracelets and a pair of earrings - from the Near East, the         area from the eastern Mediterranean to Persia. <br clear=all>      <hr>      <blockquote>        <p></p>      </blockquote>      <div align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         <a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other         Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font></div>      <p>      <p>&nbsp;     </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
