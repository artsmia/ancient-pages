      <p>This exhibition will consist of approximately 40 photographs by Berenice 
        Abbott (American, 1898&#150;1991) drawn primarily from the Institute&#146;s 
        permanent collection. Abbott is acknowledged as a pre-eminent influence 
        in American photography, who was active from the late 1920s through the 
        1960s. Most well known for her heroic yet affectionate photographs of 
        New York City in the1930s, she was also widely recognized for her skillfully 
        realized scientific photographs and for her portraits of notable artists 
        and writers.</p>

      <p><b>Wood Turning In America from 1930 to the Present</b><br>
        October 21&#150;December 30, 2001<br>
        Target Gallery (admission to be charged) </p>
      <p>This exhibition is organized by the Wood Turning Center and Yale University 
        Art Gallery and will feature approximately 125 objects of turned wood, 
        including pieces from institutional and private collections. Because of 
        the Industrial Revolution, the art of wood turning started to be revived 
        in America in the 1930s through the impetus of James Prestini (represented 
        in the Institute&#146;s collection). Following WWII, interest in pure 
        design and the influences of Scandinavia inspired the likes of Bob Stocksdale 
        and Philip Moulthrop. Their successors have been pushing the limits of 
        the medium ever since. The more experimental and challenging approach 
        to wood turning between the 1960s and the 1990s will be the main focus 
        of this exhibition.</p>
      <p> <i>This exhibition is made possible by grants and support from: The 
        Windgate Foundation, the Center for the Study of American Art and Material 
        Culture at Yale, the Yale University Art Gallery, Robyn and John Horn, 
        Ruth and David Waterbury, and The Warnick Family Foundation, Inc.</i></p>

      <p><b>Jack Lenor Larsen: The Company and the Cloth</b><br>
        December 1, 2001&#150;March 10, 2002<br>
        U.S. Bank Gallery </p>
      <p>Using Jack Lenor Larsen fabrics, the exhibition looks at high-end textile 
        manufacturing in the last half of the 20th century, emphasizing its international 
        character and close association to contemporary western aesthetic preferences. 
        The focus is creative design and production, bringing attention to a variety 
        of issues affecting the end product, including the evolution of cottage 
        production to high-tech manufacturing, the availability of materials, 
        tariff restrictions, trade wars and other issues. The Jack Lenor Larsen 
        archive was formally given to the museum and the University of Minnesota 
        in 1999.</p>
