Her densely layered abstractions employ a combination         of sewing, collage, painting and digital photography. Particularly through         her collage, Padberg explores the place between order and chaos, what         she calls &quot;the texture of everyday life.&quot; Her work references         traditionally feminine tasks, such as quilt-making and domestic record-keeping,         which are often undervalued by contemporary society.      <p>Toscani is known for large, machine-like forms constructed from sheets         of welded steel. She sees herself as a product of the sixties &#150;her         sculpture is reminiscent of pop culture in that she includes everyday         materials such as lawn chair fabric, rubber and TV trays to fabricate         whimsical, ridiculous and sometimes ominous constructions. Through her         work, Toscani forges a fresh relationship between the beautiful and the         mundane.      <p>&nbsp;       <hr>      <div align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a href="padberg_events.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/events.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Events&nbsp;</a></font><a href="padberg_gallery.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/photo.gif" width="24" height="16" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;         Photo Gallery&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other         Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font> </div>      <p>&nbsp;     </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
