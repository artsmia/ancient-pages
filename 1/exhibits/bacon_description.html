Over 50 paintings and 18 triptychs illustrate         the many dimensions of Francis Bacon&#146;s imagery, from his notorious         early crucifixion and seated pope themes to his lifelong preoccupation         with distorted, postmodern human figures. Patrick Noon, Patrick and Aimee         Butler Curator of Paintings and 20th Century Sculpture at The MIA, considers         Bacon to be one of the premier painters of the twentieth century. Noon         cites Bacon&#146;s extraordinary, if disquieting, vision of the human         condition in modern times and his sheer technical bravura as reasons for         his appeal to contemporary audiences.</p>      <p>Bacon, born in Dublin to English parents, had no formal training as an         artist. After earning a modest reputation in the 1920s as a modernist         interior designer, he began painting in 1929. He first established himself         as a major artist in 1944, when his now-famous triptych <i>Three Studies         for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</i> was exhibited in London.         Beginning in 1949, Bacon exhibited his work internationally and attracted         attention from art critics in London, New York and Paris for his disturbing         portrayal of figures distorted to such an extent that they appear to be         turned inside out.</p>      <p>Bacon&#146;s personal, expressionistic style continued to develop within         the figurative tradition throughout the 1950s, even as the art world embraced         abstraction. Major retrospectives at London&#146;s Tate Gallery in 1962         and Paris&#146;s Grand Palais in 1971 finally established Bacon&#146;s         pre-eminence as a modern master. </p>      <!-- <p><font color="#660000"><b>Register to win two Northwest airline tickets         to London!</b></font></p>      <p><b><font color="#660000">Visit the city where Francis Bacon established         himself as one of the greatest British painters of the 20th century.</font></b><br clear=all>      </p>-->      <hr>      <p align="right"><b><a href="intro.html"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         </font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a href="bacon_events.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/events.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Events&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><a href="bacon_gallery.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/photo.gif" width="24" height="16" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;         Photo Gallery&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;<a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0"></a>         <a href="intro.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font></b>       </p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
