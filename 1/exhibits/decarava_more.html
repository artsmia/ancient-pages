He turned to photography in the late         1940s and quickly mastered the vocabulary of the small, hand-held camera,         which was rapidly becoming the hallmark of advanced American work.</p>      <p>Among the earliest works in the exhibition are photographs that first         appeared in the book <i>The Sweet Flypaper of Life</i> (1955), with a         fictional text by Langston Hughes. DeCarava made many of the pictures         after winning a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1952 - the first awarded to an         African-American photographer - which allowed him to spend a full year         photographing daily life in Harlem. </p>      <p>In 1956 he embarked on an extensive series of photographs of jazz musicians.         Many of the jazz pictures, such as <i>Coltrane on soprano</i> (1963),         show individuals absorbed in the act of creation. Others, such as <i>Billie         Holiday</i> (1953), are warm and affecting portraits. Together with photographs         of Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson, Norman Lewis, and others, these portraits         form an important body of work.</p>      <p>DeCarava quit his job as a commercial illustrator in 1958 and for most         of the next two decades earned his living as a free lance photographer.         In 1963 he helped found the Kamoinge Workshop, an association of African-American         photographers based in Harlem. In 1975, he ended his freelance career         to teach photography at Hunter College, where he is Distinguished Professor         of Art at the City University of New York.</p>      <p>In the early 1960s DeCarava&#146;s work grew more tough-minded in response         to racial discrimination, notably in pictures of laborers in New York&#146;s         garment district and of civil rights protests. <i>Mississippi freedom         march, Washington D.C.</i> (1963), made at the historic March on Washington,         exemplifies the photographer&#146;s instinct for isolating the essential         detail. Instead of attempting to encompass the vast event, DeCarava&#146;s         picture enters into the spirit of the march, distilling a collective determination         and hope in the expression of a single face.</p>      <p>A life-long New Yorker, DeCarava almost always has photographed close         to home. His art has continued to evolve, as his work from the mid-1980s         attests. DeCarava&#146;s hand-camera style rejects artificial light as         an intrusion upon experience and thus accepts deep shadow and blur as         marks of authenticity. Beginning in 1985, DeCarava elaborated this principle         in pictures whose long exposures make the blur of motion an active stylistic         device.</p>      <p><font size="-1">The exhibition, organized by The Museum of Modern Art,         New York, and its accompanying publication were supported by a grant from         the Metropolitan Life Foundation.
