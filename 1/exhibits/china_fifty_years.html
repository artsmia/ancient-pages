      <p>This exhibition includes some of the most significant images made in 
        China by both Asian and Western photographers since 1949. It presents 
        cultural, political and everyday life as seen by great photographers of 
        the era. Their insights on a country long virtually closed to the West 
        evoke a magnificent land and its people and an extraordinary time in history. 
        The exhibition captures the complex and passionate attachments that bind 
        both the native-born and foreign artist to China for a lifetime. A fully 
        illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.</p>
      <p> <i>The publication and exhibition are made possible by Ford Motor Company, 
        in keeping with its commitment to the life and culture of China and its
