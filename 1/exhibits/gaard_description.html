The portraits represent an         optimistic side of Gaard, who considers them, "Monuments to both life         as identity and to the humility of representation."       <p>For two decades, Gaard's reputation was linked to Artpolice, the underground         grafix collective magazine that he created and guided, and to a body of         work that depicted nightmarish, sexually explicit images. He is also well-known         for his provocative writing and criticism and for his honest discussion         of manic- depression, an illness that has informed both the content and         construction of his work.       <p>Born in 1948, Frank Gaard earned a B.F.A. degree from the school of the         Art Institute of Chicago in 1967 and an M.F.A. from the California College         of Arts and Crafts in 1968. He served as a professor of fine arts at the         Minneapolis College of Art and Design from 1969 to 1987. Gaard has exhibited         his work regionally, nationally and internationally.       <p>&nbsp;       <hr>      <div align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">         <a href="gaard_gallery.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/photo.gif" width="24" height="16" border="0" align="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;         Photo Gallery&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <a href="intro.html"><img src="../GIF/exh_icons/exhibits.gif" width="24" height="16" align="top" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Other         Exhibits&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></font> </div>      <p>&nbsp;     </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
