      <p>Arnold Newman is one of the best-known and most distinguished portrait 
        photographers of the 20th century. He pioneered &#147;environmental portraiture,&#148; 
        a style that places subjects in carefully composed settings that capture 
        their work and personality. Since the 1930s, Newman has used his impeccable 
        technique and innovative strategies to photograph many of the most accomplished 
        people of the century &#150; artists, writers, actors, composers, politicians 
        and others&#150; for publications such as <i>Life, Holiday, Fortune</i> 
        and <i>The New Yorker.</i></p>
      <p> Exhibition sponsored by the law firm of Fredrikson &amp; Byron.</p>
