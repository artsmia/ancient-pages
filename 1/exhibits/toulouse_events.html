Join us for a two-day conference on         the community of Montmartre in Paris in the 1890s, when popular culture         and fine art first began to forge an alliance that remains with us today.         Discover the role cabaret performers, visual artists, religious institutions         and street life played in creating a new mass culture. The conference         will provide both a historic context for questions about publicly accessible         visual culture and a critical basis for examining issues surrounding this         culture today.       <p>This symposium is held in conjunction with the exhibition <i><b>Henri         de Toulouse- Lautrec and the Performers of Paris</b></i>, on view in the         19th century Prints and Drawings gallery from February 27 - September         19, 1999. Symposium attendees will also have the pleasure of viewing a         private exhibition in the Herschel V. Jones Print Study Room featuring         the works of Edgar Cahine, Pablo Picasso and Th&eacute;ophile Steinlen.       <p>For more information, or to register, please call the museum's Visitor         and Member Center at 612/870-3131. Registration is free but pre-registration         is required.       <p>&nbsp;      <hr>      <h3><font color="#660000">Adult Class: The Bohemian Life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec<br>        Saturday, April 10</font></h3>      <p>A look at the life and art of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, with special         focus on his poster designs and the images they depict.</p>      <blockquote>         <p><b>Section S300</b><br>          Saturday, April 10<br>          10:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.<br>          Fee - $30, $20 members and seniors<br>          Lunch on your own<br clear=all>        </p>      </blockquote>      <hr>      <h3><font color="#660000">Adult Class: Sketching in the Galleries: Henri         de Toulouse-Lautrec<br>        Four Saturdays, May 22, 29 &amp; June 5, 19</font></h3>      <p>Students will draw from the pieces in the exhibition <i><b>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec         and the Performers of Paris</b></i>.
