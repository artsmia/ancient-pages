The Department of Asian 	  Arts has benefited greatly from generous gifts from	  knowledgeable collectors. Augustus L. Searle, Alfred F.	  Pillsbury, Richard P. Gale, Louis W. Hill, Jr., and Ruth and	  Bruce Dayton have donated specialized collections of	  international reputation, including ancient Chinese bronzes,	  ancient and post-Sung jade, Chinese monochrome ceramics,	  Ukiyo-e paintings, Japanese prints, and classical Chinese	  furniture. In addition, highly regarded specialized collections of	  Ch’ing dynasty silk textiles, Miao textiles, and surimono prints	  have been built over the years.	  </p>	  <p>The Department’s goal is to provide the public with a broad	  overview of Asian art. In 1998 the museum presented the Indian, 	  Islamic, Himalayan, Southeast Asian, and Korean permanent collections.	  </p>	  <p>An original reception hall from the late Ming dynasty and an	  18th-century Suchou-area library are now in place. In October 	  2001 two Japanese Period Rooms will open.	  </p>	  <p>The renowned collections of 17th- and 18th-century Chinese	  furniture, literati objects, and paintings have been acquired	  through the extraordinary generosity of Ruth and Bruce Dayton. 	  While building these focused collections, the Daytons have 	  strategically added important gifts of sculpture, ceramics,	  bronzes, gold, calligraphy, and Nanga painting.	  </p>	  <p>	  Japanese Art Galleries 221 through 225 are temporarily closed to 	  accommodate the installation of two new historically based Japanese 	  rooms. These galleries typically exhibit Japanese ink painting, 	  woodblock prints and tea ceremony arts. Japanese Art Galleries 	  205, 220, 219, and 226, which exhibit archaic arts, Buddhist arts, 	  "Native Sensibilities," and contemporary ceramics, remain open 	  during construction.	  </p><p>	  The rooms will open in a permanent installation called "Sumptuous 	  and Sublime: Two Japanese Rooms," on Saturday, October 6. Gallery 	  222 will house the Audience Hall and 225 the Tea House.	  </p><p>	  A related symposium on October 5 and 6, and a private donor dinner 	  on October 6 kick off the grand opening of these beautiful rooms.	  <p>	  Japanese Galleries 221, 223, and 224 will also re-open to the 	  public October 6.	  </p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      </td>    <td rowspan="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>    <td colspan="3">      <p>&nbsp;</p>	  <p><b>Highlighted Work</b></p>	  <p>&nbsp;</p>	</td>	  <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>	<tr>	        <!---Here's where inquery inserts the info	  Here's what you need to change	  	  Set the upper limit of RandRange to the number of documents in the key.	  Change the key in the URL (it appears after /key/).	  You can find these by looking at the URLs of the collection pages.	  	  Change the ref to the site relative URL for this page.--->	  	  <cfif NOT ISDefined("item")><cfset item = RandRange(1,278)></cfif>	  <cfhttp method="POST" url="http://www.artsmia.org/uia-bin/uia_list.cgi/mia_collection_include.ldb/key/asian/page_len/1/noframes/page/#item#">	    <cfhttpparam type="FORMFIELD" name="ref" value="/collection/asian/index.cfm">	  </cfhttp>	  <cfoutput>#CFHTTP.FileContent#</cfoutput>	  <td>&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>	<td colspan="3" valign="top">	<p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><b>Browse</b></p>	  <p>        <a href="/uia-bin/uia_list.cgi/mia_collection.ldb/key/asian/noframes/page_len/10"><img src="../images/asian_browse.gif" width="37" height="45" alt="Asian Arts" border="0" align="left">		Selected Works from the Asian Art Collection</a><b> </b></p>      <hr align="center">      <p><b>Electronic Postcards</b></p>	  <p>        <a href="/uia-bin/uia_list.cgi/artsmia_cards.ldb/key/asian/noframes/page_len/10">		<img src="../images/send-a-postcard.gif" width="54" height="37" alt="Link to postcards" border="0" align="left">		Send a postcard from our Asian Art Collection</a></p>      <hr align="center">      <p><b>Collection Related Online Programs:</b><br>      </p>      <p><a href="/arts-of-asia/" target="_top"><img src="../images/arts-of-asia-icon.gif" width="37" height="45" alt="Arts of Asia" border="0" align="middle">	  <b>Arts of Asia</b></a></p>      <hr align="center">      <form action="/permanent/search.cfm" method="post" target="_top">        <b>Search the Museum's Collection</b></p>				<p>        Over 2,000 works from our collection are available online.
