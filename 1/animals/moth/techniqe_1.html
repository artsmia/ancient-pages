The term also         refers to the print made by inking such an incised surface.         Though sometimes all intaglio prints are referred to as         engravings, the word more specifically applies to those made         with a tool called a GRAVER or BURIN, which is a small metal         rod with a sharpened point. This tool is pushed across the         plate, cutting a V-shaped line in the metal         surface.<SUP>2</SUP><BR>                  <BR>                  Etching is a process in which the lines in a metal plate are         bitten (etched=eaten) by acid. The polished surface of the         plate is first covered with a thin layer of GROUND, which is         composed of waxes, gums, and resins. The etcher draws         through the ground with a metal point (the "etching         needle"), which exposes the metal. The plate is then         immersed in a bath of acid, which bites into the plate along         the exposed lines. Since the etching ground offers almost no         resistance to the needle, the artist has much the same         freedom as in drawing. <SUP>3</SUP><BR>                  <BR>                  Although Merian was trained as an engraver (she was perhaps         the first female engraver of copperplates), she did not         undertake this task for the Surinam project as she had for         her other works. The 60 plates were engraved by three Dutch         artists working from the watercolor studies she had made.         The prints made from these plates were then hand-colored         with watercolor by either Merian or another artist.         <I>Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium </I> was published         in a folio volume in 1705. It was printed in Amsterdam in         both Latin and Dutch. Other editions were published after         Merian's death.<BR>                  <BR>                  Moths, Caterpillar, and Foliage was engraved by Joseph         Mulder, whose signature appears on the print. He probably         used etching to copy Merian's image, which he then         reinforced with the engraving process. It is likely that         Merian herself hand-colored the print, using transparent         watercolor that allowed the engraved lines to remain         visible.         <HR>         <SUP>2 Paul Goldman, Looking at Prints, Drawings and         Watercolours: A Guide to Technical Terms (Malibu: J.
