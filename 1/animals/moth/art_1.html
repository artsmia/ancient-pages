She wanted to study Surinam's insects in         their natural setting, observing their METAMORPHOSIS and         choice of food. Funded by the city of Amsterdam, Merian         worked in the colony for two years, assisted by her         daughters. During this time, she observed, recorded, drew,         collected specimens, and interviewed the native people.         While she originally intended to catalog only insects, she         expanded her studies to include snakes, reptiles, birds, and         monkeys. In 1701 Merian returned to Amsterdam, bringing with         her extensive notes, drawings, and specimens. Four years         later her ambitious volume <I>Metamorphosis Insectorum         Surinamensium</I> (The Metamorphosis of Surinam Insects) was         first published. Its 60 large plates, engraved by three         Dutch artists working from Merian's watercolor studies, show         bananas, pineapples, grapes, lemons, pomegranates,         watermelons, papayas, and other plants, all supporting the         life stages of beautiful moths and butterflies and some         extremely large spiders and beetles.<BR>                  <BR>                  The PRINT <I>Moths, Caterpillar, and Foliage</I> is from her         Surinam portfolio and reveals Merian's interest in the         accurate portrayal of the various stages of a moth's         development on one plant, in this case the <I>Agrippina</I>         White Witch moth on a rubber tree. Moths develop by         metamorphosis, a process that includes four different and         distinct stages. The process begins when an organism known         as a caterpillar (or larva) emerges from an egg; this         creature is completely different from the adult it will         become.<SUP>1</SUP> The first stage of development is         represented here by the egg mass, the yellow form attached         to the plant's trunk. The next stage, the larva or         caterpillar, is shown crawling along the plant with sinuous         movement; it has been feeding on the foliage, evident in the         leaves that have been eaten away. Merian depicts the bright         COLORS and bold PATTERNS and stripes of the caterpillar,         illustrating with remarkable clarity the details of its         anatomy, such as its segmented skin covering, bristly hairs,         yellow head, and clawed legs. The third stage of the moth's         life cycle is the pupal stage, during which the caterpillar         changes into an adult insect. In preparation for this stage,         the caterpillar spins around itself a silken cocoon, the         egg-shaped form shown attached to thetree trunk. Merian's         rendering, using SHADING, suggests the swollen, expectant         quality of life about to emerge. The final stage, the adult,         is represented by two moths, one in graceful flight         alighting on the plant, the other resting on a leaf with its         wings folded back. Perhaps both are included to show the         spectacular patterns and varying colors of the inner and         outer wing surfaces. The lavender color of the closed wings         contrasts with the neutral tones of the wide-spread open         wings as viewed from above.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <SUP>1 Mauro Daccordi, Paolo Triberti, and Adriano Zanetti,         </SUP><I><SUP>Simon and Schuster's Guide to Butterfiles         &amp; Moths</SUP></I><SUP> (New York: Simon and Schuster,         1987), 10.</SUP><BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
