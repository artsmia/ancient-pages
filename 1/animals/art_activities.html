He allowed his hand to         wander spontaneously over the page and then gave the         resulting work a title. Klee called this process "taking a         line for a walk."</P>                  <P>A. Draw animal contours.</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>1. Take a long piece of string and drop it on         the floor or on a table.</P>                  <P>2. Look at the shape made by the string and try to find         the form of an animal in it. (Drop the string several times,         until you get an arrangement you like.)</P>                  <P>3. On a piece of paper, draw the animal you see in the         string. Follow the line of the string carefully, without         taking your pencil off the paper--as if writing in cursive.         (Pretend the pencil is a magnet, attracted so strongly to         the paper that you cannot take it off.) Try drawing with a         dark-colored crayon and then painting over it with         watercolors, to create an environment for the animal. The         waxy crayon "resists" the paint and will not be covered up.         </P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P>B. Make continuous-line drawings of animals from pictures         in magazines or books. Pay special attention to the contour         lines (the edges of shapes within the animal), not just the         outline.</P>                  <P>C. Create wire animal sculptures based on your drawings,         using only one long piece of wire. It should be thin wire,         with the ends taped to prevent injury.</P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Teacups with Scenes from "The Fox and         the Stork"<BR>                  </FONT></B><A HREF="teacups/teacups.html">(image)</A></P>                  <P>Design and draw an eating container for another animal         perhaps one in this unit (<A HREF="images.html">Index of         Images</A>). Keep in mind the size and shape of the animal's         mouth, the height of the animal, and the kind and amount of         food the animal eats. <U>Consider</U>: In the story of the         Fox and the Stork, why was the plate a bad container for the         stork's dinner? Why did the tall vase work better for the         stork than for the fox?</P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Moths, Caterpillar, and Foliage<BR>                  </FONT></B><A HREF="moths/moth.html">(image)</A></P>                  <P>Maria Sibylla Merian was both a scientist and an artist.         She drew insects in order to study them and to record how         they appear in nature.</P>                  <P>A. Collect some insects and examine them under a         microscope, or collect pictures of insects. Draw the         insects, paying special attention to patterns and shapes.         </P>                  <P>B. Print your insect drawings, using flat Styrofoam         printing plates, as follows:</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>1. Draw the design on the Styrofoam, pressing         lightly to make indentations in the surface.</P>                  <P>2. Using a brayer or a rolling pin, roll acrylic paint or         printing ink over the printing plate's surface. Spread the         ink evenly and not too thickly.</P>                  <P>3. Gently lay the printing plate face down on a piece of         paper cut slightly larger than the plate. Then press down         firmly.</P>                  <P>4. Keeping the paper and printing plate pressed together,         turn them over so the paper is on top. Then roll the brayer         or rolling pin over the paper several times. Be sure to roll         evenly over the paper's entire surface.</P>                  <P>5. Gently peel the paper away from the printing plate to         see the image. Many prints can be made from one printing         plate. Experiment with different colors of paper and ink.         </P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A NAME="bridge"></A></FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Bridge-Spout Vessel in the Form of a         Fish<BR>                  </FONT></B><A HREF="bridge/bridge.html">(image)</A></P>                  <P>This ceramic vessel reflects the importance of fish and         of the natural environment in the world view of the Nazca         people of ancient Peru.</P>                  <P>A.

Imagine that you live in the same environment you         chose for the animal, and make a vessel out of clay that         reflects that environment. Keep in mind the climate, the         animals, the needs of the people (such as food, clothing,         containers, tools), and the people's level of technology.         </P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Benin Bronze Leopard<BR>                  </FONT></B><A HREF="leopard/leopard.html">(image)</A></P>                  <P>This leopard was made to symbolize the power and status         of the Benin king, called the oba.
