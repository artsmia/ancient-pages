Comprising five         pairs of figures-court officials, warrior guardians, earth         spirits, horses, and camels-the set is distinguished by its         fine <A HREF="../glossary.html#modeling">MODELING</A>,         large-scale figures, abundant use of rare cobalt blue glaze,         excellent surface condition, and the fact that it has         survived intact. It is one of the few complete tomb sets in         existence and one of only two in Western collections.<BR>                  <BR>                  The horse was perhaps the most popular of all subjects to         the T'ang potter. It is portrayed here with a lively, robust         quality typical of T'ang ceramic art. One of only three such         blue-glazed horses known to exist and the largest and best         of those three, the horse is the highlight of the         Minneapolis tomb set. It stands four-square on an unglazed         rectangular base, with its neck arched, its head down and         turned slightly to one side. The dynamic curve of the mane         creates a striking profile and accentuates the tense energy         of the powerful neck. Although standing at ease, the horse         appears to be full of spirit, poised to move at any         moment.<BR>                  <BR>                  Elegant and noble in appearance, this steed is glazed in a         brilliant, deep cobalt with a contrasting white-and-brown         streaked mane. The lavish use of cobalt blue, instead of the         ordinary straw-colored glaze, indicates that the retinue was         commissioned by a wealthy family who could afford this rare         and costly material imported from Persia. The saddle has         been left unglazed, and the paint that once decorated it is         now gone. (Real saddles in the T'ang period were probably         wooden and covered with leather.) The richly ornamented         harness trappings are derived from Sassanian Persian         metalwork design, and reflect the T'ang love of the         exotic.<BR>                  <BR>                  Eagerly sought for centuries, fine horses came to China from         professional horsedealers of Asia. The animals were of         tremendous importance to T'ang China rulers, who used them         for military purposes and diplomatic tribute. Vast horse         herds were maintained by the Chinese government and         horsemanship was regarded as an aristocratic privilege.         Horses were important in providing an efficient mode of         travel on the Silk Road and were vital to the military         forces defending the borders of T'ang China. It is not         surprising that the Chinese chose the horse-their favorite         riding animal-to accompany them in the afterlife. Besides         providing the deceased with a means to ride into battle,         play polo, or hunt, the horse was a symbol of power,         prestige, and wealth.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
