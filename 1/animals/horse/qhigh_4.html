What is            <A HREF="../glossary.html#naturalism">NATURALISTIC</A>            about this horse? What is not naturalistic?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>How would you describe this horse?

Why do you think so?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>The technique used to glaze this horse is called san            t'sai, which means "three-color." What colors are used            here? Cobalt blue glaze was very rare and expensive and            had to be imported into China. Why might an artist use            cobalt glaze on a horse like this?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>What other object in this unit may have been made to            include in a tomb? Both used ceramics for works of art.            Which culture do you think was more advanced in its            ceramic techniques?
