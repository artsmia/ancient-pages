There springs         to the mind's eye a picture of richly caparisoned horses,         gay clothes, dancers, musicians, merchants of all nations,         vast teeming cities into which the wealth of Asia seems to         pour in a steady stream. There comes to mind a sense of a         robust forward-looking people of education, endowed with a         keen appreciation of the arts.<SUP>1</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P>One of the most vigorous cultural periods in Chinese         history, the T'ang dynasty, from 618 to 906 A.D., was an era         of expansion, ferment, and prosperity. The major power         between the Yellow Sea and Persia, China held widespread         influence and traded extensively with countries far beyond         its own frontiers. As the largest and strongest power on         earth, her trade goods--particularly silks, ceramics, and         metalwork--were highly regarded by the rest of the world.         During the T'ang, the famous trans-Asian "Silk Road" was at         its peak, remaining for centuries the world's greatest trade         corridor. Covering over 7,000 miles, the silk routes         stretched from India to China--skirting the scorching         deserts of Central Asia and ending in the cosmopolitan         cities of Chang-an (present-day Xian), the capital, and         Lo-yang. Diverse people traveled along these routes,         including merchants in caravans bearing exotic luxury items,         as well as diplomatic emissaries, monks, pilgrims, and         entertainers.</P>                  <P>During this period, the influx of foreigners had an         invigorating effect on the Chinese intellect and creative         spirit. A number of influences entered into T'ang         aristocratic life, for example, Indian religions and         astronomy, Persian textile patterns and metalcraft, Turkish         costume, and horses from Central Asia. The impact of these         influences on Chinese art was significant and pottery was         one of the art forms clearly affected. T'ang ceramics         display the robust vitality, cosmopolitanism, and technical         advances that characterize the period.<SUP>2</SUP></P>                  <P>Though it was an era of exotic taste, the Chinese         continued their long-established practice of placing wood         and clay figurines of humans and animals in the burial         chambers of the deceased. These articles, which are referred         to as <I>ming-ch'i</I> (ming-chee), meaning "spirit         articles," were produced to accompany and protect the dead         in the afterlife. Hundreds of figures, including soldiers,         servants, musicians, tomb guardians, horses, camels, and         models of articles used in everyday life, were placed in         tombs.</P>                  <P>These figures were produced in abundance during the T'ang         period, when funeral processions and burials became quite         extravagant. In fact, a special imperial government office         was created for the production and supervision of         <I>ming-ch'i</I>, regulating the number and type of grave         objects. The office also regulated the arrangements of         funeral processions not only of the aristocracy but of the         common classes as well. T'ang funeral processions were         relatively festive occasions, as well as somewhat         ostentatious gestures of filial piety. Mourners would often         carry the grave furnishings, including ceramics, to the tomb         while crowds of people stood by to observe the procession.         An ancient account relates that some families, in an effort         to compete with their neighbors, incurred financial         disaster.<SUP>3</SUP> Eventually, an imperial decree issued         in 742 set limits on the size and number of tomb pieces         allowed, based on the rank of the deceased.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <SUP>1 Margaret Medley, </SUP><I><SUP>T'ang Pottery and         Porcelain </SUP></I><SUP>(London: Faber and Faber, 1981),         11.</SUP><BR>                  <SUP>2 Much of this article is adapted from Robert Jacobsen,         "Ceramic Tomb Sets of Early T'ang,"         </SUP><I><SUP>Minneapolis Institute of Arts         Bulletin</SUP></I><SUP>, vol. 64 (1981).</SUP><BR>                  <SUP>3 M.
