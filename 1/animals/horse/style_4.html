Larger figures, such as this horse, were         often made by combining several molds with some         hand-modeling to construct large, hollow pieces of         sculpture. All works, whether mass-produced or otherwise,         had to be finished by hand, a process that displayed the         artist's skill, as is evident here in the horse's sense of         proportion, spontaneity, and movement. The T'ang interest in         naturalism is apparent in the careful attention given to the         form of the horse, with its accurate proportions, distinct         musculature, and lifelike posture. Its modeling conveys the         artist's thorough understanding of a horse's anatomy.</P>                  <P>This horse is made with the glazing technique of <I>san         t'sai </I> (tsahn-tsigh), one of the unique ceramic         developments of the T'ang period. <I>San t'sai </I> means         "three-color" and usually refers to green, amber, and cream         glazes found on T'ang burial ceramics. Many variations of         the hues were used, however, so that the colors were not         necessarily limited to three, and black and blue glazes were         often included as well. The glazes produced a brilliant         effect, well suited to the splendor of the age. The         <A HREF="../glossary.html#palette">PALETTE</A> primarily         used here includes blue, green, and caramel-colored glazes.         The rare and costly blue glaze, usually reserved for the         best and most striking figures, was associated with more         important tombs.</P>                  <P>In the san t'sai process, the figure was covered with a         white <A HREF="../glossary.html#slip">SLIP</A> before the         glaze was applied. Slip is a fluid mixture of clay and water         that works like a primer coat of paint or gesso, smoothing         out the surface and giving it an even color. The use of slip         helps to impart a clearer, brighter quality to the colored         glazes than would be the case if the glazes were applied         directly to the earthenware. (Because earthenware is         composed of iron, it tends to discolor glazes.) After the         application of slip, the body was covered with colored lead         glazes. Because of their liquidity, lead glazes tend to run         and streak. They flow and blend during the firing process,         resulting in a luxurious interplay of colors, splashes, and         drips. The fluidity of the colors was often exploited by the         T'ang potter to obtain unexpected streaks and drips,         contributing to the object's beauty. Despite the free and         random nature of this process, it required extreme skill and         sensitivity.</P>                  <P>While the artist's interest in realistic detail is         apparent in the horse's form, a quality of fantasy and         generalization is also conveyed by the treatment of color.         The glazes have been applied to produce a decorative and         sumptuous effect rather than a realistic portrayal of the         horse's color. The dynamic curve of the mane is heightened         by its light colors and striped design, which contrast with         the deep, brilliant blue of the body. The horse's bold         colors and forms create a striking figure of remarkable         splendor.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
