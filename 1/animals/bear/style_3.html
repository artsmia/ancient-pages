Like         artists such as N.C. Wyeth and Charles Russell, who also         worked as illustrators at the turn of the century and         depicted the West, Goodwin was interested in capturing what         he actually experienced.</P>                  <P>Goodwin creates a tranquil setting using subdued, earthy         colors and soft, undulating contours. The white, spare         <A HREF="../glossary.html#landscape">LANDSCAPE</A> is a         striking <A HREF="../glossary.html#contrast">CONTRAST</A> to         the dark and imposing bear and provides an opportunity for         the artist to show off the animal's thick coat of fur and         its rich brown coloring. In this painting, Goodwin         accurately depicts the details of the bear's form and         anatomy--its massive, hunched body, soft brown fur, peering         eyes, foraging nose, heavy legs, and large and formidable         claws. His careful delineation draws our eye to the bear and         the Cream of Wheat container, the centerpiece of the         painting. The crate's prominent position in the         <A HREF="../glossary.html#foreground">FOREGROUND</A>, its         large <A HREF="../glossary.html#scale">SCALE</A>, distinct         <A HREF="../glossary.html#geometric shape">GEOMETRIC         SHAPE</A>, and bold letters reinforce it as the focus of our         attention and the reason for this advertisement. Varying his         paint application, Goodwin uses loose and sketchy         brushstrokes in surrounding areas, as in the screen of trees         in the <A HREF="../glossary.html#background">BACKGROUND</A>,         the sky, and the blanket of snow. The soft dashes and thick         dollops of paint create a sense of immediacy, enhancing the         vibrant energy and activity of the bear.</P>                  <P>Goodwin's use of vertical and horizontal lines and         triangular shapes contributes to the stable and tranquil         mood of the scene. The rhythmic vertical lines of the         backdrop of trees meet the restful horizon line, which is         repeated in the lines of the crate. The somewhat triangular         shape of the bear is echoed in the pine trees as well as in         the tree stump to the right, conveying a harmonious         relationship between the bear and its habitat.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
