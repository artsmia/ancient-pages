Its tracks mark the         surrounding snow, reflecting the bear's deliberate movement         in pursuit of its quarry. Exhibiting characteristic         curiosity, independence, and voracious appetite, the bear         appears to be perfectly comfortable in this winter         wilderness, as it displays its deft survival skills. The         painting conveys a clever marketing message by suggesting         that the bear was lured from its winter den by the cereal.         This is a testimony indeed to the alluring nature of Cream         of Wheat since, normally, the bear would spend the winter in         deep hibernation.</P>                  <P>To promote a product, Goodwin has created a charming         narrative scene as well as a compelling image. An innately         strong and intelligent animal, the bear evokes a gamut of         associations and connotations. American history is laced         with tales of bears. Pioneer explorers such as Lewis and         Clark and Davy Crocket encountered the grizzly bear in their         push westward. Traditionally admired and respected by native         Indian peoples for its extraordinary power, the bear is         frequently represented on Native American art objects.         Inspiring terror as well as amusement and affection, bears         are especially intriguing to people, in part because we         recognize human behavior in them. As powerful and dangerous         as bears can be, they also evoke benign associations such as         those related to the gentle and cuddly teddy bear, the         responsible Smokey Bear, the delightful Winnie the Pooh, or         the beguiling, hospitable animals in the fairytale         Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</P>                  <P>Despite the large and lumbering nature of this bear,         Goodwin emphasizes its         <A HREF="../glossary.html#anthropomorphic">         ANTHROPOMORPHIC</A> qualities. How human it appears as it         sits and savors the cereal! Using its front paws like human         hands, the bear firmly clutches the crate and nuzzles its         mouth and nose greedily into the box. Its hearty appetite         and obvious enjoyment could easily be translated to human         experience. The image suggests that if you eat Cream of         Wheat, you too will be strong, fortified, and able to         survive the challenges at hand. In addition, the pristine         and invigorating aura of the snow-covered wilderness         reinforces the pleasure to be experienced when eating this         hot cereal.</P>                  <P>Although we see a tranquil, unspoiled setting, the Cream         of Wheat crate and its commercial label is a reminder of         human activity and the encroachment of civilization and         industrial growth. While we cannot be sure if the trees here         have been felled by natural disaster or by human exploit,         Goodwin provocatively juxtaposes the wooden crate&oacute;a         by-product of the lumber industry&oacute;with the adjacent         tree stump. Perhaps it is a commentary on the possessive         attitude people have toward natural resources and the human         desire to domesticate not only the environment but animals         as well. Today, from our late-20th-century vantage point, we         lament the consequences of such activities as we struggle to         preserve our vanishing wilderness areas and endangered         wildlife.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How                  to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your Comments Wanted</A>                  </CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
