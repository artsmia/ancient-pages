Goodwin</FONT></B></P>                  <P>Born in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1881, Philip Russell         Goodwin began sketching and painting as a child, and made         his first sale&oacute;an illustrated story&oacute;to         Collier's when he was 11. He studied at both the Rhode         Island School of Design and the Art Students League in New         York City, as well as with Howard Pyle at Pyle's Brandywine         School at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Known as the Father of         American illustration, Pyle inspired an entire generation of         illustrators through his work and his teaching. The Wyeth         family continues this tradition to the present time.</P>                  <P>By 1904, Goodwin had his own studio in New York City and         was working on commercial assignments, producing         illustrations for McClure's Magazine, Collier's, and         Everybody's Magazine, as well as covers for Saturday Evening         Post. His subjects always included wildlife, and he         specialized in painting action-filled hunting scenes for         sporting goods calendars. He also painted animals for circus         posters and advertisements for various prominent companies,         including the Cream of Wheat Company. Goodwin illustrated a         number of books about animals and is best known for the         illustrations he created for the early editions of Jack         London's Call of the Wild and Theodore Roosevelt's African         Game Trails. Working from subjects he observed both in the         zoo and in the wild, he also made wax sculptures of animals,         which were then cast in bronze.</P>                  <P>A passionate outdoorsman and a skilled horseman, Goodwin         enjoyed spending time in wilderness areas such as the Maine         woods, the Colorado Rockies, remote areas of Canada, and the         Montana mountainside lodge of his close friends, the artist         Charles Russell and his wife Nancy.</P>                  <P>Goodwin died at age 54, having earned little recognition         by art circles. In recent decades, however, he has been         rediscovered by collectors of wildlife, hunting, and fishing         scenes.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
