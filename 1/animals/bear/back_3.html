During this         period, books and periodicals were major sources of public         entertainment. Periodicals were in every home, and         illustrated novels were widely read. Since photography was         not yet an alternative for publishers, illustrators served         as reporters, providing a visual portrayal of the American         scene.</P>                  <P>During the early part of the 20th century, the Cream of         Wheat Company advertised its cereal in many         publications.<SUP>1</SUP> In one of the most successful         campaigns in American advertising, the company commissioned         popular artists to produce paintings for advertisements,         which were reproduced in magazines such as Ladies' Home         Journal, Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and McClure's.         Among these works was Philip Goodwin's A "Bear" Chance,         commissioned by the Cream of Wheat Company in 1906 and         completed in 1907. The painting graced the office walls of         the Minneapolis company, which later became part of Nabisco.         In 1970 the Nabisco Company donated the painting to The         Minneapolis Institute of Arts.</P>                  <P>Throughout the history of advertising, animals have been         used to promote products and concepts, attracting human         interest with their popular appeal and fascinating,         mysterious qualities. Many examples come to mind that are         widely recognized today, for instance, Tony the Tiger,         Charley Tuna, and Smokey Bear.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE><BR>                           <HR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">1 First marketed in 1893 by a group of flour         millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota, Cream of Wheat cereal         was an instant popular success. The growing business moved         to Minneapolis in 1897, where it remains today as the         Special Products Division of the National Biscuit         Company.</FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
