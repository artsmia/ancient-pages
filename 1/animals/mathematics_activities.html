Is         this effect used anywhere else in the photograph? What can         you conclude about how the eye perceives depth?</P>                  <P>B. <A HREF="full_size/07.jpg">Measure the length of the         beach</A>. If an inch equals one mile, how long would the         beach be in miles? Suppose the photograph was taken from a         height that was 10 times the length of the beach. What         height was it taken from? (For example, if the beach is 4         miles long, the photograph was taken from a height of 40         miles.)</P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Thematic Activity</FONT></B></P>                  <P>Gather pictures of many different animals, including some         of those in the "Amazing Animals" unit. Notice the sizes and         proportions of various parts of the animals' bodies. For         example, a giraffe's head and ears seem very small for the         size of its body. Its nose is short compared to its neck and         legs but long for the size of its head. Which is longer, the         legs or the neck?      </TD></TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~         <A HREF="images.html">Index of Images</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals         Activities</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
