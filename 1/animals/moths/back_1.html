Important to this         period of growth were the European voyages of exploration to         distant lands such as the Americas, the Near and Far East,         and Africa, which resulted in a tremendous increase in         <A HREF="../glossary.html#botany">BOTANICAL</A> and         zoological knowledge. Travelers returned to Europe with         drawings and written descriptions as well as new seeds and         plants to be studied and classified. The microscope, which         was invented in Holland in the late 16th century, was a boon         to the study of plants and animals, transforming the         sciences of botany and zoology.<BR>                  <BR>                  In the early 17th century, the Dutch emerged as Europe's         leading horticulturalists. Their passion for gardening and         the cultivation of exotic flowers spurred the development of         flower painting as an art form as well as botanical         illustration of all kinds, including catalogues of flower         species.<BR>                  <BR>                  Although she was primarily an entomologist (one who studies         insects), Merian is also recognized as one of the finest         botanical artists of the period. Her work was influenced by         the great Netherlandish flower painters of the 17th century.         She carefully studied living examples of butterflies and         moths, recording their appearance and activities at various         stages in their life cycles. Her remarkable illustrations         from these studies appeared in various publications. In         these publications, Merian represented the results of her         research on a single page, arranging the insects on or near         the plants with which they were associated. While her         methods seem logical to us today, they were at the time, as         she declared on her title page, "a completely new         discovery." The contemporary practice of studying insects         relied only on preserved specimens in collectors'         cabinets.<BR>                  <BR>                  Working at a time when the natural sciences were in their         early development, Merian contributed to the knowledge of         her era. She helped to revolutionize the sciences of zoology         and botany and to lay the foundations for the classification         of plant and animal species.<BR>                  <BR>                           <HR>         <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
