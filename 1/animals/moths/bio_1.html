Her father, who died         when she was three, was a noted engraver who published one         of the first catalogs of different flower species. Her         mother's second husband was a Dutch flower painter, Jacob         Marell, with whom Merian studied. In 1665 she married one of         her stepfather's pupils, the artist Johann Graff, and         settled with him in Nuremberg. Their first daughter was born         in 1668, and a second daughter in 1678.<BR>                  <BR>                  In Nuremberg, Merian began methodically to explore and paint         the world of nature, studying living examples of European         butterflies and moths. She published her resulting         illustrations, which were enthusiastically received by the         scientific community.<BR>                  <BR>                  Merian left her husband in 1685 and, with her two daughters,         made a series of moves, living for a time in Friesland,         Germany, and then in Amsterdam. In 1699 she set sail for         Surinam, where she spent two years, until a bout with yellow         fever forced her to return to Amsterdam. The results of her         trip were more than a 100 watercolors painted on vellum,         most of which are now in the British Museum. Many of these         were engraved for the volume <I>Metamorphosis Insectorum         Surinamensium</I>. Merian next turned her attention to         completing a final volume of her European insect book. She         suffered a stroke in 1714 and died in 1717.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
