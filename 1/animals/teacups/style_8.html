This style, which         emulates the classical world of Greece and Rome, is called         NEOCLASSICAL. Contrasting with the curving forms and         elaborate flourishes of earlier porcelains, the flatter,         straighter surfaces and simple lines of the neoclassical         style were inviting to painters. In fact, painting assumed a         new importance as it often now covered the entire surface,         hiding the white porcelain, which traditionally had been         displayed.</P>                  <P>The painted scenes unfold around the outside of each cup,         edged by gilt on the border and foot that continues inside         and completely covers the interior of each cup. Glowing         brilliantly, the tea service gives an impression of         preciousness and resembles metalwork.</P>                  <P>The landscape scenes are painted in a naturalistic style,         reflecting Caron's emphasis on direct observation, which can         be seen in the animals' physical characteristics, stances,         and gestures. He focuses our attention on the animals and         their actions, setting them front and center against a         neutral backdrop of soft fluffy trees in one scene and a         rocky embankment in the other. Behind the stagelike settings         are soft blue skies and idyllic landscapes. The muted         browns, greens, and blues of the BACKGROUNDS allow the vivid         white, black, and red HUES of the stork to stand out, as         well as the rich rust and white fur of the fox and the shiny         gold and blue vessels from which the animals eat. Despite         the miniature scale of the paintings, the subjects are         clearly and exquisitely defined, attesting to the meticulous         skill of the artist.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
