The         service was ordered in 1807, the year following Napoleon's         defeat of Prussia in his imperial campaigns. Each of the 12         cups and saucers and 4 serving pieces is richly adorned with         scenes derived from the famous fables of the French writer         Jean de la Fontaine.</P>                  <P>La Fontaine, who lived from 1621 to 1695, was a popular         French poet and         <A HREF="../glossary.html#fabulist">FABULIST</A> whose         fables have enchanted generations of children and adults.         His poetic interpretations were based on fables that had         proven their vitality in popular tradition. La Fontaine         frequently drew upon the Greek author Aesop, whose legendary         fables about clever, foolish, greedy, and generous animals         have been a source of inspiration to artists and writers for         centuries. The subjects portrayed on this tea service         reflect not only the popularity of La Fontaine's fables, but         also the interest in motifs from nature that occurred during         the 18th and 19th centuries.</P>                  <P>The images depicted on these cups are based on episodes         from "The Fox and the Stork." In this fable, Mr. Fox invites         Miss Stork to dinner and serves clear soup in dishes so         shallow that the stork, with her long beak, is unable to sip         even a drop. Alas, after watching her host lap up his         dinner, she goes home still hungry. In the next scene, Miss         Stork invites Mr. Fox to dinner and serves a thick soup in         tall vessels with a long narrow neck. The stork can now eat         with ease, inserting her beak in the jar, while the fox,         unable to reach his food and feeling weak with hunger, can         only stand and watch. Reminding the fox that she simply         followed his example, the fable ends with a moral lesson:         treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.</P>                  <P>The artist Christophe-Ferdinand Caron illustrates the         fable's two main sequences on separate cups. Though his         images do not have the text to support them, Caron clearly         portrays the essence of the story, using naturalistic detail         and dramatic gestures and imbuing his animals with a sense         of mischief and personality. In the first scene, the fox         eagerly laps up his soup from the gold dish on the ground,         while the stork stands by intently observing him. She stands         erect with wide-open wings and prancing, fluttering         movement. Her body language suggests her outrage at the         fox's rude indulgence as well as her own feelings of hunger         and frustration. The tables are, turned, however, on the         second cup, where the stork savors the meal with her long         beak nestled deep into the tall blue vessel. Contrasting         with her animated posture in the first scene, her         contentment and pleasure are now apparent. But the fox         appears distressed and forlorn, cowering toward the ground,         his tail tucked beneath him.</P>                  <P>Though Caron is concerned with a realistic portrayal of         the animals' physical features, he reveals their behavior to         be more like humans than like animals. Caron portrays the         fox and the stork with careful attention to anatomical         detail, showing the heavy build of the stork, its bright red         bill and legs, its broad wings and long neck, and its boldly         patterned plumage of black and white. He also renders the         fox's long, sharp snout, its pointed ears, and its bushy         tail. Nonetheless, there is a fairytale quality to the         scene, partially due to its         <A HREF="../glossary.html#scale">SCALE</A>, reminding one of         toylike miniatures. Moreover, the animals are engaged in the         human activity of dining together, indeed with utensils         produced and used by humans.</P>                  <P>By their very nature, fables use stereotypes to convey         certain human characteristics; in this case the fox, which         we associate with craft and cunning, is an appropriate         deceitful and greedy character. The stork, which has the         legendary reputation in Europe as the bringer of babies and         symbol of good luck, fits the role of the innocent victim of         the fox's wiles who behaves with intelligence to teach the         fox a lesson. Suggesting both the foibles and the wisdom of         the fox and the stork, Caron gives us a caricature of human         beings and human behavior. Like the writers La Fontaine and         Aesop, Caron portrays animals to delight, amuse, and teach a         moral lesson, as well as to decorate this luxury tea service         with picturesque charm.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
