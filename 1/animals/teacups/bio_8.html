With the         help of factory records and marks on porcelain, it is         sometimes possible to identify these individuals. We know         that the service was painted by Christophe-Ferdinand Caron.         </P>                  <P>Caron was born in St. Cloud, outside of Paris, and was         associated with the Sevres manufactory from 1792 to 1815 as         a specialist in animal painting. This tea service, which         took him over six months to execute, is one of his greatest         achievements. He also decorated many of the plates of the         service used personally by the emperor Napoleon.</P>                  <P>Fascinated by animals, Caron made drawings on his         frequent visits to the botanical gardens and zoo in Paris.         He also used engravings and documents as sources for animal         and landscape images. In 1815, due to failing eyesight,         Caron retired from the Sevres manufactory.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
