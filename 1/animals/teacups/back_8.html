Porcelain had been made         in China since the 7th century, and was occasionally         imported to the West where it was considered a rarity and         luxury. For centuries Europeans sought the formula for         making porcelain, but it was not until the early 18th         century that the secrets of its production were discovered         in Germany.</P>                  <P>During the second half of the 18th century, France became         the leading porcelain manufacturer in Europe. The center of         the French porcelain industry was located at the national         porcelain manufactory at Sevres (sev-vr), a suburb of Paris.         Setting the fashion in ceramics from around 1760 to 1815,         the Sevres factory was recognized for its rich colors, the         quality of its individual painters, and the opulence of its         <A HREF="../glossary.html#gilt or gilded">GILT</A>         decoration.</P>                  <P>Though it began in private hands, Sevres soon came under         the royal patronage of King Louis XV. It became a government         enterprise and is still operating as one today. It was         extensively patronized by Napoleon Bonaparte, for whom some         very ambitious items were produced. These pieces included         enormous vases decorated with allegories of his victories,         tables set with painted porcelain plaques, and elaborate         dinner and tea services. Contributing to the glory of his         reign, these porcelain objects were frequently presented by         Napoleon as diplomatic gifts.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE><BR>                     </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
