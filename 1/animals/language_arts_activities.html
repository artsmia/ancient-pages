Write about an animal you might use as a symbol for         yourself. Explain your choice in your essay.         <U>Consider</U>: How does this animal represent you? What         qualities do you share with the animal?</P>                  <P>B. Write a praise poem. Praise poems grew out of the West         African oral tradition of praise songs, which raise someone         to a place of honor by making the community aware of what         that person accomplished for family and community. Although         their form varies, praise poems usually include the         following:</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>The person's ancestry<BR>                  The person's physical or social endowments, including those         of ancestors<BR>                  Many references to nature<BR>                  Metaphors</P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P>Write a praise poem for the leopard or for the ruler it         symbolizes. Combine your observations of physical         characteristics with praise for qualities such as grace and         power.</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>1.

Look at the leopard and write a list of words and         phrases that describe it.</P>                  <P>3. A simile is a comparison using <I>like</I>  or <I>as         </I>: Her eyes shone like stars. Write a few similes based         on your list of words and phrases; these will be used in the         poem.</P>                  <P>4. Praise poems often contain metaphors. A metaphor         likens one thing to another by pretending they are the same:         His eyes were two shining stars. Write three metaphors for         the leopard.</P>                  <P>5. Now use your similes and metaphors in a praise poem         commemorating the leopard or the ruler symbolized by the         leopard.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Untitled Photograph by Jane         Tuckerman<BR>                  </FONT></B><A HREF="untitled/untitled.html">(image)</A></P>                  <P>Write a mystery story about the place pictured in this         photograph, using things you see in the photograph as clues.         <U>Consider</U>: What do you think this place is like?

Your fable might explain         how the animal came to possess its qualities, or it might         illustrate how the animal uses the qualities. Read Rudyard         Kipling's <U>Just So Stories</U> or Aesop's <U>Fables</U>         for examples.</P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Thematic Activity</FONT></B></P>                  <P>Consider the animals represented in this unit and discuss         what it is that makes them amazing.
