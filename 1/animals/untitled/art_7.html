At first glance, we recognize seagulls         flying over a shore, yet their forms are not entirely         discernible. Using a         <A HREF="../glossary.html#bird's eye view"> BIRD'S-EYE         VIEW</A>, the photographer has captured the gulls in various         phases of flight; some soar gracefully on outstretched         wings, while others are shown in rather awkward, erratic         positions. Some forms appear as shadows or mere fragments,         blurred and difficult to identify. Particularly disturbing         is the large dark gull form looming ambiguously above the         horizon line. It seems strangely out of scale. Is it a bird         or a shadow? Is it flying or falling from the sky? More         clearly defined is the gull on the right edge of the         photograph that seems to be suspended, hovering in midair.         The close proximity of these birds to the camera's lens and         the cropped format of the photograph contribute to their         mysterious presence.</P>                  <P>To add to the conundrum, many questions arise when we try         to define the scene from our bird's-eye vantage point. Is it         day or night? Winter or summer? Reality or fantasy? There         are signs of human habitation, but why are no people in         sight? Certain elements of this expansive scene are         recognizable: tidy clusters of plump, feathery trees, a         running fence that boldly casts its shadow across the         landscape, and a wedge of sea with its waves lapping against         the shore. But the dark areas of sea and sky next to the         brilliantly lighted landscape seem to defy a logical         explanation. Moreover, the luminous quality of the trees and         earth suggests a snowy covering--not green grass and fertile         soil, where such hardy trees would be expected to flourish.         </P>                  <P>Strong contrasts of light and dark contribute to the         photograph's sense of mystery. The rich blacks of the         shadows are intensified when cast against the glowing white         tones of the trees and ground. A diffuse band of radiant         light separates the dark sky from the murky black water. The         glowing wings of a gull echo the wispy, ethereal cloud         forms, conveying a sensation of movement with their blurred         effects.</P>                  <P>Tuckerman is interested in conveying the mysteries of         nature, its vastness and its power. Growing up on a farm in         the remote countryside of Massachusetts, she is sensitive to         the overwhelming forces of nature. In her photograph, the         expansiveness of the landscape and its luminescent qualities         evoke a sense of hushed quietude. While some might interpret         this as a contemplative scene, others may perceive it as         ominous and foreboding. Open to interpretation, her work is         richly evocative, appealing to the imagination of the         viewer.<I>         <HR>         <BR>                  </I><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
