Its art tradition         is famous for its sense of refinement and sophistication.         Although little is known of Benin's early history, the         kingdom was a great military and commercial power by the         time the first Europeans arrived there in the late 15th         century. The accounts of travelers during the 16th century         describe the beautiful city of Benin, the kingdom's capital,         as a highly organized religious and administrative center         ruled by the oba. Vast and splendid, the royal palace         complex was richly adorned with cast bronze decorations,         carved wooden lintels, pillars, and beams, and ivory         carvings.</P>                  <P>The oba was believed to be the reincarnation of Benin's         original ruler and, therefore, divine. He was the central         figure in the kingdom--the supreme political, judicial,         economic, and spiritual head of his people. Because the oba         acted as intermediary between his divine ancestors and the         Benin people, it was believed that he personally controlled         the forces affecting the well-being of the entire kingdom.         Regarded with a combination of awe, reverence, and fear, the         oba had power over the life and death of his subjects.</P>                  <P>Surrounded by elaborate ceremonies and rituals, the oba         and his ancestors were commemorated with         <A HREF="../glossary.html#symbol">SYMBOLS</A> of prestige in         the form of bronze heads, figurines, and plaques. Most Benin         art was made to glorify the oba and to pay homage to past         obas, expressing the special power and privileges of this         ruler and reinforcing the complex hierarchy of the court.         </P>                  <P>Benin's first direct contact with the European world came         in the 15th century with the arrival of the Portuguese. The         kingdom established diplomatic and trade relations with         Portugal, and Portuguese traders supplied luxury items such         as coral beads and cloth for ceremonial attire. In return         Benin provided the Portuguese with items such as pepper,         cloth, and carved ivory. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the         Dutch, French, and English surpassed the Portuguese in trade         with Benin. Dutch traders provided detailed descriptions of         the royal palace and its artworks, which are particularly         significant since this palace was destroyed by fire in 1897.         </P>                  <P>The kingdom of Benin flourished until the end of the 19th         century. Then in 1897, it was overcome by a British military         expedition. Despite the loss and destruction caused by this         event, the kingdom still exists today within the modern         state of Nigeria. The oba has been restored and continues to         serve as a religious leader, though his political authority         is greatly diminished.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE><BR>                           <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
