The         vessel was filled through a round, hinged opening at the top         of the leopard's head; when tipped, water poured out through         its pierced nostrils. This type of water vessel in form,         called an <I>aquamanile</I>, derives from European types         made from about 1100 to 1500 and used in both religious and         secular contexts. Such vessels may have been known in Benin         through trade with Europe.</P>                  <P>When not being used, the leopard aquamanile stood on the         oba's ancestral altar in the royal palace courtyard. Other         bronze objects such as plaques and heads would have been         displayed with it. Leopards were usually made in pairs; the         mate to this leopard is in a museum in Munich, Germany.</P>                  <P>Admired for its power, ferocity, agility, and         intelligence, the leopard became a symbol of the oba.         According to Benin thought, the leopard could strike fear         into the heart of the enemy; it also was recognized as a         leader in the animal kingdom. Images of leopards appeared on         many objects of royal paraphernalia, reinforcing the oba's         majesty and power. Live leopards, captured and tamed, were         kept at the royal palace. Placed on leashes, they even         accompanied royal processions. Leopard skins, which were         emblems of rank in Benin, could be worn only by the oba and         those who obtained his permission. When a hunter killed a         leopard he was expected to report to the nearest chief that         it was a "leopard of the bush," not one "of the house." Like         the royal art of Benin, the leopard essentially belonged to         the king, signifying his superior status.</P>                  <P>This sculpture conveys the strength, cunning, and wary         alertness characteristic of a leopard. Standing firmly on         sturdy, muscular legs, the animal looks straight ahead with         its ears perked and its fangs bared, a reminder of its         awesome power. It displays many of the conventions used for         leopards in Benin art, such as overlapping canines, distinct         molars, slanted eyes, and leaf-shaped ears. The richly         <A HREF="../glossary.html#texture">TEXTURED</A> bronze         surface possesses a dull black patina and has been         painstakingly incised with small circles to represent the         leopard's spots. These are set against a stippled         background.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
