The earliest         clearly identifiable group was the Paracas civilization,         whose tombs contain sophisticated examples of weaving and         pottery. Following the Paracas, the Nazca civilization         flourished from about 200 B.C. to A.D. 600. Since the Nazca         people possessed no written language, much of their culture         remains enigmatic. We know something about the Nazca,         however, because they used art to communicate ideas         visually, making textiles and ceramics of extraordinary         technical and artistic quality. These objects offer clues to         the everyday life, customs, and beliefs of this culture from         long ago.</P>                  <P>A country of geographic extremes, Peru is situated on the         western edge of the continent of South America, bordered by         the Pacific Ocean and dominated by the central Andean         Mountain chain. Between the highlands and the ocean         stretches a long, narrow coastal desert cut at intervals by         river valleys. This is where the Nazca settled. Human         habitation was possible in this arid and forbidding desert         because of the natural features of the sea and a series of         small rivers threading down from the Andes. Although these         rivers often remained dry for months--even years--at a time,         towns developed along their banks. The economy of the Nazca         towns was based on agriculture, supplemented by the rich         fisheries of coastal waters. The Nazca developed intricate         irrigation systems with underground canals to transport and         conserve water, attesting to their high level of engineering         skills and their ingenuity in adapting to the desert         environment.</P>                  <P>Reflecting the natural environment, Nazca ceramics are         adorned with subjects related to the people's primary means         of subsistence--farming and fishing. Common motifs include         fish, aquatic birds, and reptiles, as well as fruits and         vegetables such as chili peppers, maize, and lima beans.         Complex composite figures appearing in later works combine         various human, animal, and bird attributes. The Nazca may         have connected these figures to agricultural fertility and         water. Because of scarce rainfall on the desert, and their         dependence on the         <A HREF="../glossary.html#ecology">ECOLOGICAL</A> balance of         the natural environment, the Nazca were intensely concerned         with their relationship to nature.</P>                  <P>It is evident that burial of the dead was important to         the culture since tombs have been found containing vast         numbers of intricately woven textiles, colorful ceramics,         and rich metal work. Many of the numerous tombs discovered         in the river valleys were looted over the centuries by         people searching for marketable artifacts. Enough, however,         have been excavated scientifically         by<A HREF="../glossary.html#archaeologist">         ARCHAEOLOGISTS</A> to show that the dead, often interred in         chambers with adobe-brick walls, were supplied with an array         of tomb offerings. Thanks to the arid desert climate, large         numbers of these offerings have been well preserved.</P>                  <P>In addition to tomb artifacts, the region is marked by         one of the most unique and puzzling archaeological phenomena         of South America--the Nazca Lines. Extending for miles,         these networks of <A HREF="../glossary.html#line">LINES</A>,         spirals, geometric         <A HREF="../glossary.html#shape">SHAPES</A>, and animal         figures, such as fish and birds, crisscross the desert in         and around the Nazca area. They have been dated to the same         period as the manufacture of Nazca ceramics. Because of         their giant scale, the lines can only be seen without         distortion from the air. They were made by removing the         darkly weathered surface stones to expose the underlying         lighter sand and gravel. While there has been much debate         about their purpose and meaning, it is likely that they were         made as markers for processional routes to places believed         to be sacred. Many of these figures repeat the forms seen on         painted ceramics and may be religious         <A HREF="../glossary.html#symbol">SYMBOLS</A> connected with         the sea, sky, and mountains. They are perhaps related to a         set of rituals associated with the bringing of water to the         Nazca Valley.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">1</FONT></SUP>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>         <HR>         <FONT SIZE="-1">1 Craig Morris and Adriana Von Hagen,         </FONT><U><FONT SIZE="-1">The Inca Empire and its Andean         Origins</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="-1"> (New York: Abbeville         Press Publishers, 1993), 88.</FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
