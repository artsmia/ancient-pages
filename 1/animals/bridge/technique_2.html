The coil marks are not visible because they were         carefully smoothed off with damp cloths, scrapers, and stone         polishers. Some modeling was used to shape the head, tail,         and fin area. The double bridge-spout handle was made in a         mold and then joined with the body. The holes in it would         have allowed air to escape during the firing process. The         vessel was probably covered with a         <A HREF="../glossary.html#slip">SLIP</A>, a thin overall         clay wash, and then painted with mineral pigments before it         was fired.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
