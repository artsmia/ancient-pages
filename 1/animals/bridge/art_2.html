It has a double         bridge-spout handle a distinctive feature of Nazca pottery.         While the vessel's specific function is not known, its         double spout would facilitate the pouring of liquids, while         the bridge handle would be practical for tying onto packs         carried by animals, or, if it were larger, for hand         carrying. Because of the small size of this vessel, however,         a utilitarian function seems unlikely.</P>                  <P>Renowned for their         <A HREF="../glossary.html#polychrome">POLYCHROME</A>         decoration, Nazca ceramics display the greatest chromatic         range of all the ancient New World ceramics. This vessel         features a variety of COLORS orange and red-browns, mauve,         white, black, and gray. Using warm earth colors and bold         black lines, the artist achieves an effect of both         tranquility and dynamism.</P>                  <P>The artist has skillfully combined         <A HREF="../glossary.html#two-dimensional">TWO</A>- and         <A HREF="../glossary.html#three-dimensional">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</A>         means to represent a fish. Made with smooth contours and         rounded forms, the figure has an inflated, swollen         appearance suggesting fertility and abundance. The fins are         represented by small modeled protuberances that project from         the back, sides, and lower surface of the fish. Painting on         the vessel's surface delineates other features and creates a         bold <A HREF="../glossary.html#linear">LINEAR</A> design.         The viewer is engaged by the large round eyes, the smaller         circles representing nostrils below them, and the strangely         bared teeth, a menacing touch to this seemingly benign         creature. The short, quick lines repeated on the upper part         evoke the fish's scales and animate the surface with a         lively <A HREF="../glossary.html#pattern">PATTERN</A>. The         fan-shaped bands radiating from the sides of the mouth         represent the gills, emphasized perhaps for their essential         function in the breathing process. The bold horizontal         stripes on the vessel's sides may refer to the distinct         designs on certain types of fish, such as the striped bass.         The stripes may even represent the lateral line, a sensory         structure that runs along a fish's body and detects         vibrations. The lines intersect with a         <A HREF="../glossary.html#chevron">CHEVRON</A> form on the         fish's tail, suggesting the tail's dynamic force in helping         the fish to swim and producing a striking decorative effect.         </P>                  <P>Whatever the significance of these elements to the Nazca         culture, it is clear that this artist observed the natural         world and drew upon the rich colors, forms, and patterns         found in nature. This sculpture expresses the vital spirit         of the fish and its importance to the Nazca         people&oacute;not only as a dietary staple and a source of         nourishment, but also as a symbol that was integral to the         mythology, religion, ceremonies, and rituals of a community.         </P>                  <P>This vessel is cracked around the head area and broken at         the tail. Its condition is a reminder of its ancient history         and also of the paradoxical nature of pottery. Despite its         fragile quality, pottery is extremely enduring, offering         tantalizing clues to archaeologists and attesting to the         life of ancient cultures. Though we do not know the origins         of this vessel, its generally well-preserved condition         suggests that it came from a protected area such as a tomb.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
