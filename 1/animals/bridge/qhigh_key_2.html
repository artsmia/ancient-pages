Fishing is a popular form of            recreation. Fish are important in the ecological chain            since they help maintain the balance in nature; they feed            on some plants and animals and become food for others.)            </B><BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>The Nazca people lived in river valleys near the            ocean, mountains, and desert.
