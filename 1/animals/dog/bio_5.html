His parents were         musicians, and Klee at an early age displayed unusual talent         both as a violinist and as a         <A HREF="../glossary.html#draftsmanship">DRAFTSMAN</A>. As a         young boy, Klee was constantly observing and drawing from         nature, filling sketchbooks with renderings of fish,         flowers, fruits, and birds and forming a vast storehouse of         <A HREF="../glossary.html#naturalism">NATURALISTIC</A>         observation from which he would draw throughout his career.         </P>                  <P>Although he briefly considered a career in music, in 1898         he chose to attend art school in Munih where he studied for         three years. Dissatisfied with conventional academic         training, he spent the next decade going through a process         of self-education and self-discovery. He struggled to         achieve an independent voice through extensive         experimentation in etchings, glass paintings, charcoals, and         watercolors, using only black and white. Following his         association with the Blaue Reiter group in Munich, he         traveled to Tunisia, a journey that inspired a new sense of         color in his work. During World War I, he served in the         German army.</P>                  <P>In 1920 Klee joined the faculty of the Bauhaus, an         innovative school that became the center of modern design in         Germany during the 1920s. He taught there for over a decade.         He was represented in a number of exhibitions during the         1920s and 1930s, and his reputation as a significant artist         became established. When Hitler came to power in 1933,         Klee's long career in Germany was brought to a close, and he         was dismissed by the Nazis from his teaching position at the         Dusseldorf Academy. He and his wife left Germany and         returned to his native Bern. Despite increasingly fragile         health, Klee worked with great intensity until his death in         1940. Creating over 9,000 works of art in his lifetime, Paul         Klee is recognized as one of the most inventive and         influential artists of the 20th century.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
