What is the animal            doing? Is this animal scary, friendly, strong, playful,            gentle? Would you like to have this animal for a pet? Why            or why not?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Klee described his work as "taking a line for a            walk." Follow the path of the line that describes the dog            with your eyes. Can you find a place where the line            begins? Where the line ends? How would you describe the            line? Does it hop, skip, glide, dance, howl? Where does            the line move quickly? Slowly? Where does the line repeat            itself? Where does the line intersect?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Part of Klee's line describes a dog, another part            describes a moon. What do you think the rest of the line            describes?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Klee was very interested in music and sometimes            described lines as being "melodic." If the lines in this            painting were music, would they sound fast or slow? Loud            or soft? What kind of song do these lines sing? An opera?            A polka? Rock and roll?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>What color is the dog? Where else do you see this            color? What color is the moon? Where else do you see this            color? What other colors do you see? Where?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Klee's lines are very energetic; they move around a            lot and give the whole painting a sense of movement. What            else moves around a lot in the painting? <B>(Color.)            </B>Is there anything else that gives the painting a            sense of movement and energy? <B>(Brushstroke.) </B>What            does this tell you about the way the painting was            made?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Klee painted an            <A HREF="../glossary.html#abstract">ABSTRACT</A> dog by            emphasizing line, shape, color and texture instead of            including details to make his dog            <A HREF="../glossary.html#naturalism">NATURALISTIC</A>,            as a dog would truly appear. What details has Klee left            out? How do you think the mood of the painting would            change if Klee had painted a naturalistic dog?         </OL>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
