Amid accelerated social         changes and innovations of the early 20th century, however,         many artists rejected the notion that art must imitate         nature. They often regarded a painting as a flat surface         covered with colors, lines, and shapes that need not         represent anything from the visible world. Artists         increasingly looked to sources outside the Western         Renaissance tradition, such as the art of Asia, Africa, and         Oceania. This attitude led to intense experimentation, to an         emphasis on the artist's personal vision and imagination,         and to a broad spectrum of artistic styles and approaches         ranging from naturalism to abstraction.</P>                  <P>Paul Klee, like many artists in the early 20th century,         wanted to reveal a world that had never been seen before. He         wrote:</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Art does not reproduce the visible; rather it         makes visible. Formerly we used to represent things on         earth, things we either liked to look at or would have liked         to see. Today we reveal the reality that is behind visible         things.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">1</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">         </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P>To understand that reality, Klee avidly studied nature.         He observed that nature is never static, but goes through         continuous cycles of growth and change-becoming, growing,         ripening, and fading. Klee believed that the artist's         creative process is similar to creation in nature and that         the formal elements, such as the point, the line, the         <A HREF="../glossary.html#plane">PLANE</A>, and         <A HREF="../glossary.html#space">SPACE</A>, and the         relationships among them, go through a similar process of         growth and change.</P>                  <P>Klee's closeness to nature influenced both his subject         matter and his working methods. Throughout his career, he         explored the relationship between nature and cosmic forces,         searching for symbols and signs to express his ideas. He did         not draw a clear distinction between art and writing, and         many of his paintings are a form of writing, incorporating         signs, arrows, floating letters, and codes for objects. Klee         was also inspired by folk art and children's drawings, which         appealed to him because of their directness, innocence, and         spontaneity. An accomplished violinist, Klee thought of         painting as similar to music in its expressiveness and its         ability to touch the spirit of its viewers through color,         form, and line. His work often depicts elements associated         with sound and the principles of musical composition.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>         <HR>         <SUP>1 Paul Klee, "Creative Credo," published in Herschel B.         Chipp, Theories of Modern Art<BR>                  (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1968),         182-86.</SUP>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
