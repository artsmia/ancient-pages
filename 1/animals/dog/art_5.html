Although this could be perceived as an         <A HREF="../glossary.html#abstract">ABSTRACT</A> image, or         indeed, as a scrawled doodle, the title Howling Dog plays an         integral part in the viewer's perception and helps one         decipher the image. The ambiguous shape emerging to the left         of the dog&oacute;with its playful flow and         movement&oacute;evokes the sound of a dog's prolonged howl.         Or perhaps it suggests another animal and the communication         between two animals that a howl might signify. The artist         creates a joyful mood with his use of line&oacute;thin and         caricaturelike, rhythmic in its movement and repetition, and         clearly articulated against the haziness of the background.         Rendered as nearly continuous, the line has an         improvisational character, dancing across the canvas,         curving slowly at times, or skipping quickly back and forth         across itself. The viewer shares in the artist's creative         process by following the movement of the line traveling         through space.</P>                  <P>The line composes puzzlelike forms that appear         <A HREF="../glossary.html#organic">ORGANIC</A> and seem to         float on a diffuse ground with no specific reference to         location. The swirling background is composed of soft,         dreamy colors&oacute;patches of green, violet, and orange         framed by a loose border of gray&oacute;and creates an         ambiguous space that evokes a sense of mystery.</P>                  <P>Klee described his works as "taking a line for a walk."         He viewed a line as a point wandering through space and         allowed his hand to follow its own impulse. Insisting that         the process is more important than the finished product,         Klee often began his works with no definite goal in mind,         and he let the line, color, or medium dictate its own         evolution. Sometimes specific images emerged, like the         howling dog and the moon. After he completed the work, he         would title it.</P>                  <P>Though Klee saw the process of creation as an intuitive         act arising from the individual spirit of the artist, he         recognized that it is also guided by the artist's reason,         imagination, and experiences. All these factors resonate in         Howling Dog. While the lines may appear simple, spontaneous,         and freely wandering, they are in fact controlled by the         artist's deft hand and intellect, his witty imagination, and         his lifelong experience drawing and observing animals in the         natural world. Klee captures the dog's essence, conveying         its tension and energy as well as its fundamental character         as part of nature. Unlike A "Bear" Chance, where Goodwin         shows the influence of civilization and the domestication of         the wild, Klee's painting does not allude to any human         presence. This dog is not a family pet or a human's         companion but, rather, an animal revealing its basic         instinctive existence, communicating with the moon and         perhaps with other animals.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
