Though his work defies stylistic         categorization, he assimilated the ideas of the various         modern art movements that flourished in Munich in the early         20th century, particularly those of the Blaue Reiter (Blue         Rider) artists. This group, which was united by Wassily         Kandinsky and Frans Marc, shared with Klee the belief in the         spiritual essence underlying all the arts. Klee was also         introduced to the Fauves and Cubists during a visit to Paris         in 1912.</P>                  <P>Throughout his career, Klee moved freely between         figurative painting and abstraction. While Howling Dog has         clear references to nature in the dog and the moon, the         artist approaches abstraction in his simplification of forms         and addresses the formal elements of line, shape, space,         color, and the relationships among them. The dreamlike,         fantastic quality of the image is reinforced by its abstract         nature. Typical of Klee's work, the painting is small in         scale and intimate, inviting the viewer to move in close to         decipher and examine the delicately rendered forms and enter         this mysterious world. Klee's application of color and his         rich, gestural effects contribute to the painting's         pulsating rhythm and lyrical movement, and also remind us of         the artist's creative process.</P>                  <P>Although Klee's specific working method for this painting         is not known, an important aspect of all his work is his         constant experimentation and inventiveness with unusual         combinations of materials and techniques. Sometimes he         painted on roughly textured cloth with various kinds of         paint, or on grounds built up with plaster, papers, and         <A HREF="../glossary.html#encaustic">ENCAUSTIC</A>. He         combined chalks, paste, and even crayons with paint to         create glowing colors and richly worked surfaces. Hence, as         in this painting, his technique and media often defy         analysis.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="../animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
