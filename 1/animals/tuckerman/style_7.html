Besides such technical         considerations as the type of film, exposure, and equipment,         an artist decides what to include within the frame of the         camera's lens at a given moment. In this instance, Tuckerman         made certain choices regarding framing and COMPOSITION to         create this intriguing photograph. Her decision to use a         bird's-eye view contributes to its dramatic impact. While it         is not known exactly where Tuckerman was situated when she         took this photograph, it is evident that she was high up--at         the same level as the birds in flight. The scene's spacious         quality is emphasized by the bands of sky, water, and earth,         which meet at the horizon and appear to stretch infinitely         into the distance beyond the photograph's frame. The         diagonal thrust of these elements charges the composition         with energy.</P>                  <P>Unlike the 18th-century artist Maria Sibylla Merian, who         was interested in presenting a closeup view in order to show         the precise details of moths and plants, Tuckerman uses         forms that are distant and abstracted. Yet, at the same         time, her aerial view shows us more than we could seefrom         the ground. It reveals the vast stretches of terrain, sea,         and sky, as well as nature's soft, curving forms, intricate         textures and patterns, and orderly arrangement.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
