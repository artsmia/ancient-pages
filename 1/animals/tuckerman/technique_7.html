The         questions raised by Tuckerman's perplexing photograph are         answered, in part, by the artist's use of infrared film,         which gives the photograph unusual pictorial effects and         contributes to the SURREAL mood of the image. With infrared         film, trees and grass appear white, while sky and water         record as dark. The film produces an overall grainy texture         as well, which enhances its dreamlike quality.</P>                  <P>Infrared film's special quality is its sensitivity to         infrared radiation, which is in the spectrum of light but is         not visible to the human eye. While common photographic film         records a scene in TONALITIES that approximate visual         perception, infrared film records a scene with a shift in         tonalities, which can suggest an unreal, fantasylike state.         </P>                  <P>Available commercially since the 1930s, infrared film was         first used for scientific purposes. It has a wide range of         applications, including use in criminology as an         investigative tool, in ophthalmology and other medical         fields, in the exploration of space, and in cinematography,         where it has been used to create special effects.</P>                  <P>Tuckerman is attracted to the intriguing effects infrared         film produces as well as to its unpredictable character.         About the use of infrared, she notes:</P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>There is a gossamer illusionism in         photographs taken with infrared film, not unlike the         snatches of images one conjures while day-dreaming. . . .         One does not know whether this mirage-like image is a         recording of the present or a manifestation of something         that happened either years before or will transpire at a         future date.<SUP>1</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P>Another variable that contributes to the appearance of         this photograph is shutter speed, which controls the amount         of time that film in the camera is exposed to light. A fast         shutter speed has the ability to "stop action", freezing         things in motion at the moment the photographer takes the         picture. A slower shutter speed increases blurring and         accentuates the feeling of motion. The outlines of the large         bird in the upper left of Tuckerman's photograph are blurry         because the camera's shutter speed was too slow to "stop the         action" of the bird's rapid movement. This same bird and the         one on the right edge of the picture appear almost as         silhouettes because of their close proximity to the camera         lens.         <HR>         <SUP>1 Tuckerman wrote this statement for the exhibition         catalogue </SUP><I><SUP>Invisible Light</SUP></I><SUP>,         organized by Robert Cartmell for the Smithsonian Institution         Traveling Exhibition Service, 1980.</SUP> <TABLE BORDER=1         WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
