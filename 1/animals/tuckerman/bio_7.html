She studied photography at the         Art Institute of Boston and the Rhode Island School of         Design, where she earned a master of fine arts degree. There         she studied photography with well-known photographers Harry         Callahan and Aaron Siskind, who helped shape her ideas about         photography.</P>                  <P>Represented in museum collections across the country,         Tuckerman's work has been featured in numerous national and         international exhibitions. She has been the recipient of         many fellowships and grants, including the National         Endowment for the Arts Visual Artists Grant in 1985. In 1987         she was selected to be Visiting Artist to the American         Academy in Rome.</P>                  <P>Closely related to her work as a photographer, Tuckerman         has taught photography for the past 22 years at a number of         institutions. One is Harvard University, where she was head         of the photography department for several years and         continues to teach today. She also is associate professor of         photography at the Art Institute of Boston. Reflecting on         her career as an artist and a teacher, Tuckerman said,         "[Aaron] Siskind taught me so much about being committed to         my work and to teaching. He taught me how important it is to         communicate my feelings about the medium to my students and         to show the medium great respect at all times, even when         it's not going the way I want it to."<SUP>2</SUP></P>                  <P>With her husband, photographer Christopher James,         Tuckerman traveled to India in 1985 to photograph death         rituals, an experience she considers a pivotal point in her         work. She also does painting and sculpture and at times         integrates her photographs with these art forms, reflecting         changing attitudes in recent decades regarding an artist's         freedom to cross boundaries and combine mediums.         <HR>         <SUP>2 From a telephone interview with Bonnie Gainsley,         September, 1993.</SUP> <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
