The camera was immediately         hailed as a marvel of science and technology, excelling in         its ability to record the visual world. Not only could         photographs provide evidence of how things appear, they         could even reveal details not seen by the unaided human eye.         But photography was slow to be recognized as an art form         because it was defined by its technical nature, which         involves a mechanical process and lacks the handmade quality         of painting and drawing. In the 20th century, however, it         firmly established its identity as a medium of great         aesthetic and expressive potential. Photography was         recognized to have an infinite range of TONAL VALUES and a         unique ability to capture the forms and designs, the         fascinating textures, shapes, and patterns of life. As in         all visual art forms, a work of photographic art was seen to         result from a combination of factors: an artist's personal         vision, technical skill, and ability to express meaning in         an image.</P>                  <P>Unlike the arts of painting and sculpture--traditionally         supported by museums, academies, and galleries--photography         was late to gain such institutional support. Indeed, it was         not until the 1940s that these forums for the photographic         artist began to emerge in America. The 1960s witnessed         explosive growth in support for photography as academic         programs, departments in museums, commercial art galleries,         and critical commentary developed. Since that time, great         progress has been made in the acceptance of photography as a         valid art form.</P>                  <P>In the late 20th century, photographers work in myriad         ways to communicate and express themselves. As in all the         visual arts, there has been a great deal of experimentation.         While artists respect the traditions of the past, they also         search for new meaning in their personal vision.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="../intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="../images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="../glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">Amazing Animals Activities</A> ~                  <A HREF=" ">How to Order</A> ~ <A HREF=" ">Your                  Comments Wanted</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
