Whether loyal companions, fearsome         foes, or means of sustenance, animals with their grace,         vigor, beauty, and mystery have inspired people to create         works of art. Indeed, in our earliest human records--cave         paintings produced thousands of years ago--images of animals         are depicted.</P>                  <P>The eight works of art in this set include images of         animals from diverse cultures of the world and periods of         history. Illustrating the strong and enduring connection         between humans and animals are works such as a horse made         for a Chinese tomb, a leopard made to symbolize an African         ruler, and a bear created to promote an American product.         </P>                  <P>The set explores the reasons why artists create images of         animals, considering such motives as scientific         investigation, religious beliefs, social customs,         storytelling, advertising, and personal artistic expression.         It also features a broad range of media, providing an         opportunity to study techniques used in painting,         printmaking, photography, sculpture, and ceramics. A vessel         made from the red clay of ancient Peru offers an interesting         contrast to the fine white porcelain used to make tea cups         in 19th-century France. Finally, through the works in this         set, students are invited to examine the wondrous qualities         of animals that have engaged the skills and imaginations of         artists throughout history.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~                  <A HREF="images.html">Index of Images</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~                  <A HREF="animals_activities.html">Amazing Animals                  Activities</A></CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
