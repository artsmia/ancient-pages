(Tomb Retinue:            Earth Spirits, Whistle in the Form of a Dignitary,            Tortoise-shaped Inkstone)</LI>                        <LI>What objects could you bury in a time capsule that            would show people in the future about your life?

(Teapot,            Hydria)</LI>                        <LI>Richard Bresnahan uses natural materials and            renewable resources in making his ceramics. He respects            the earth and is thankful for its many gifts. Are there            any gifts of the earth for which you are thankful? What            are they? How do you show your thanks for these gifts?            (Teapot)</LI>                        <LI>Herakles was a hero to the ancient Greeks because of            his superhuman qualities. Does a person have to be            physically strong to be a hero? In what other ways can a            person be strong? Who would you call a hero, and why is            that person a hero to you? (Hydria)</LI>                        <LI>The Hopi-Tewa people continue to make pottery in the            tradition of their grandmothers and great-grandmothers.            What is a tradition? Do you have traditions in your            family that you can trace back to your ancestors? What            are they? If you don't have any traditions, what            traditions could you start? (Seed Jar)</LI>                        <LI>How would you make a special container to hold            something that is important to you? What materials would            you use? What colors?

What            images? (Barber's Bowl)</LI>                        <LI>Some objects are decorative. They are meant to be            looked at, not used. Do you have something at home that            is just to be looked at? Write a "word picture" of this            object, and explain how you feel when you look at this            object. (Jar with Cover and Vase)</LI>                        <LI>If you were to design a ceramic object in the Art            Nouveau style, what plant or animal form would you use            for your design? Why? (Jar with Cover and Vase)</LI>                        <LI>The Yoruba people maintained altars to remember their            ancestors. Do you have any special ways to remember your            ancestors? What are these ways, and how do they help you            remember? If you don't have any special ways to remember            your ancestors, what could you do to begin remembering            them? (Shrine Head)</LI>                        <LI>Tomb figures such as the Earth Spirits were very            expensive to make and a symbol of status in T'ang dynasty            China. How do people display wealth and status in our            culture today?</LI>                        <LI>Scarification on the face of the Shrine Head            represents a way of marking a person's identity, status,            and beauty in the Yoruba culture. Body decoration also            was important to the Nayarit people since the Standing            Figure wears ear spools and nose rings. How do people            decorate and dress their bodies to show identity, status,            and beauty in our culture?</LI>         </OL>                  <P>To complement study of the Hydria, research and write a         report on the Olympic Games.
