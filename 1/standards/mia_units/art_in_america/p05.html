Individually or in small groups, create a map         of an ideal settlement location, including a key showing         symbols for features such as mountains, rivers, and forests.         (See Extension Activities, "The American Land: Westward         Ho!")</P>                  <P>To complement study of Henry Lewis's St. Anthony Falls,         listen to a reading of a report about Lewis's sketching trip         on the Mississippi River, discuss how a similar contemporary         trip would be alike and different, and write and illustrate         a journal about the latter.
