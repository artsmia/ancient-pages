Formulate a hypothesis, conduct experiments,         record findings, and draw conclusions based on results.

(See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>To extend study of Billboard's theme and Hartigan's         working technique, construct a collage that expresses the         mood of the local community, and then use the collage as the         model for a painting. (See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>To enhance understanding of Hartigan's style, draw or         paint a common object (e.g., a chair) in an abstract manner         by leaving out details, simplifying, exaggerating, and         changing various elements. (See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>Listen to selections of jazz music while looking at         Billboard, and then discuss how the various selections         influenced personal perceptions of the painting. (See         Activities, Music.)</P>                  <P>Compare visual elements to musical elements, discussing         how they are similar and different. (See Activities,         Music.)</P>                  <P>While listening to selections of jazz music, "draw" the         music and then discuss the visual compositions. (See         Activities, Music.)</P>                  <P>Listen to the original version of the song "My Favorite         Things" and a jazz version of it, and compare and contrast         the melodies, tempos, and instruments used. Discuss how the         jazz improvisation of the original song abstracts melody         just as Hartigan abstracts images to create Billboard. (See         Activities, Music.)</P>                  <P>Create a collage that reflects self or family or that         depicts the local community. (See Activities, Social         Studies.)</P>                  <P>Research facts about a community, county, state, or         country and then design a billboard that promotes visiting         that area. (See Activities, Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>Research facts about a particular place and time (e.g.,         New York City in the 1950s) and then create a collage that         conveys the essence of that place and time. (See Activities,         Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>To complement study of the bright, bold colors used in         Billboard, consider the purpose of color in living organisms         (e.g., warning/peacock, attraction/cardinal), and using         color as a theme, make a collage from images of different         animals and plants. (See Activities, Science.)</P>                  <P>Discuss complementary colors found in nature and the         purpose of these colors. (See Activities, Science.)</P>                  <P>Grow crystals from various formulas, draw the crystals,         and discuss the kinds of lines and shapes that are evident.         (See Activities, Science.)</P>                  <P>In Billboard, find examples of symmetry and asymmetry,         geometric shapes, perspective and overlapping, and parallel         lines and perpendicular lines; make sketches of the         examples. (See Activities, Math.)</P>                  <P>Make a drawing of Billboard using only straight lines,         circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, and other geometric         shapes. Analyze and discuss the effects of repetition and         overlapping of shapes.
