(See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>To enhance understanding of Hartigan's style, draw or         paint a common object (e.g., a chair) in an abstract manner         by leaving out details, simplifying, exaggerating, and         changing various elements. (See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>Examine how Hartigan conveys the "essence" of New York         City in Billboard, and then draw the essence of an object.         (See Activities, Art.)</P>                  <P>Explore the concept of cities and towns having         personalities by reading and discussing works such as         Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Sinclair Lewis's Main Street,         and John Steinbeck's Cannery Row. Do a sketch or create a         collage that captures the personality of the place described         in the story.

Discuss         how the jazz improvisation of the original song abstracts         melody just as Hartigan abstracts images to create         Billboard.

(See Activities, Social Studies.) Research facts         about a particular place and time (e.g., New York City in         the 1950s) and then create a collage that conveys the         essence of that place and time. (See Activities, Social         Studies.)</P>                  <P>Research facts about major events that occurred in New         York City in the 1950s and in the local community in the         1990s, and create two separate corresponding collages.         Compare and contrast the subjects of the collages, and         project future changes (e.g., environmental, technological)         based on the changes reflected by the collages. (See         Activities, Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>Take photographs that capture the personality of a         particular community or neighborhood and make a collage from         the photographs. (See Activities, Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>Gather information about a major historical event or         period (e.g., Civil War, Great Depression, the 1950s), and         then create a collage that captures the essence of that         event or period. (See Activities, Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>Gather information about a person of historical         significance (e.g., Thomas Jefferson, Florence Nightingale,         Martin Luther King, Jr.), and then create a collage that         captures the essence of that person's life. (See Activities,         Social Studies.)</P>                  <P>Grow crystals from various formulas, draw the crystals,         and discuss the kinds of lines and shapes that are evident.         (See Activities, Science.)</P>                  <P>Make a drawing of Billboard using only straight lines,         circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, and other geometric         shapes. Analyze and discuss the effects of repetition and         overlapping of shapes.
