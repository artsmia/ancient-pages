Individually or in small groups, create a map         of an ideal settlement location, including a key showing         symbols for features such as mountains, rivers, and forests.         (See Extension Activities, "The American Land: Westward         Ho!")</P>                  <P>Research and discuss the importance of rivers and falls         in choosing sites for the settlements of Minneapolis, St.         Anthony, and Fort Snelling.
