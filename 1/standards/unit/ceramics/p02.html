He respects            the earth and is thankful for its many gifts. Are there            any gifts of the earth for which you are thankful? What            are they?

Does a person have to be            physically strong to be a hero? In what other ways can a            person be strong?

Do you have something at home that            is just to be looked at? Write a "word picture" of this            object, and explain how you feel when you look at this            object.

Do you have any special ways to remember your            ancestors? What are these ways, and how do they help you            remember? If you don't have any special ways to remember            your ancestors, what could you do to begin remembering            them?
