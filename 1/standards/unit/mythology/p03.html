(See the &quot;Look&quot; questions about each artwork.)<p>Interpret each of the unit's artworks by responding to questions thathelp explore an artist's creative intent and the reasons behind theartist's visual choices.  (See the &quot;Think&quot; questions about eachartwork.)<p>Listen to readings or audio recordings of myths that inspired creationof the unit's artworks, and evaluate how the unit's artworks interpretthe myths and/or represent mythological characters.  (See DownloadableResources for audio files.)<p>Become aware of the symbolic content in art (e.g., attributes thatidentify mythological characters, meaningful colors).<p>Select two artworks from the same category (e.g., Hero Myths) in theonline Mythological Comparisons chart, and develop a chart that comparesthe artworks according to these categories: medium and technique,function, size, cultural origins, and style.<p>Write a myth and then create a work of art that visually interprets themyth.<p>Do various art projects that reflect functions of the unit's artworks. These are suggested projects that could involve sketches or sculpturalforms or both:<ol>  <li>Headgear that symbolizes the special powers of thewearer (e.g., King's Crown)</li>  <li>Headdress symbolic of an animal'squalities that would be useful for a human (e.g., Antelope Headdress)</li>  <li> Container that is useful and decorated with scenes from a favoritestory (e.g., Hydria)</li>  <li>Door knocker for the front door of a family'shome and that includes attributes representative of the family'sinterests (e.g., Door Knocker in Form of Medusa)</li>  <li>Rattle that hasimages from a favorite children's story and that could be used intelling the story (e.g., Chief's Rattle).</li></ol><p>To complement study of Denis's Orpheus and Eurydice, draw whilelistening to a variety of musical compositions; use different colors andlines to suggest the rhythms, melodies, and instrumentation. Tocomplement study of the Presentation Box and the concept of perspective,draw a three- dimensional object from different points of view.      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD ALIGN=right VALIGN=bottom WIDTH=76>         <P><A HREF="../../matrix.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/matrix.gif" ALT="The Standards Matrix" WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=62 ALIGN=bottom><BR>         More Standards Information</A></P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 width=76>         <P>                  <HR>                  <I>Send comments to the </I><A HREF="mailto:wlee@artsMIA.org"><I>Webmaster</I></A><I>.</I><p></P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
