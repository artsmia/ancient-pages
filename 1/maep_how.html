This curatorial department is a true       study in democracy--its exhibitions are selected by a panel of artists who       are elected by and from their peers at an annual meeting of the artist community       held each fall at the Institute. Since 1975 the program has been fundamentally       committed to the perceptions and evaluations of artists; and has produced       and presented over 130 exhibitions of contemporary art.

All artists who live and work           in Minnesota are invited to attend this meeting to participate in the           nomination and election of panel members.        <p> The Artist Panel represents Minnesota's artist community. Approximately           70 percent of the artist population resides in the seven-county metro           are and are represented by five artists from the metro area. The remaining           30 percent lives outside the Twin Cities and are represented by two           artists who live in greater Minnesota.        <p> Each panelist serves a two-year term. One-half of the panel rotates           out of office each year, a system that provides for new input while           maintaining a certain continuity.        <p> <b>Duties of an MAEP Panelist</b>        <p>         <menu>           <li>Select exhibitions using established procedures<br>          <li>Attend monthly meetings at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts <br>          <li>Guide the overall direction and development of the MAEP             <p>         </menu>        <b> MAEP Exhibition Selection</b>        <p> The panel selects exhibitions in one of three ways:        <p>         <menu>           <li>By accepting a proposal submitted by an artist or group of artists             <br>          <li>By curating an exhibition <br>          <li>By inviting a guest curator to organize an exhibition <br>        </menu>        If a guest curator is selected, she/he is entirely responsible for the         content of the exhibition and is limited only by budget and logistical         constraints as outlined by the Program Coordinator.        <p> The question of how to select exhibitions continues to be explored,           but central to the process are the evaluations and perceptions of the           artist community.        <p> All artists who live and work in Minnesota are invited to submit exhibition           proposals for consideration.        <p> <b>Panel Criteria for Selecting Exhibitions</b>        <p>         <menu>           <li>The quality of each artist's work <br>          <li>The overall balance and compatibility of the exhibition group <br>          <li>The clarity of the stated intention and the quality and focus of             the proposed exhibition <br>          <li>The cohesiveness of the stated intention and the actual work <br>          <li>The compatibility of the exhibition within the Program's annual             exhibition schedule             <p>         </menu>        <b> Exhibition Proposals</b>        <p> Proposals should include the following:        <p>         <menu>           <li>An explanation of the nature of each artist's work <br>          <li>A statement describing the intention and focus of the proposed exhibition             <br>          <li>A r&eacute;sum&eacute; of each participating artist <br>          <li>Visual documentation (usually labeled 35mm slides) of each artist's             work <br>          <li>A slide list that includes (for each image) the name of the artist             and the title,<br>            date, media, and dimensions of the work (Please do not submit slides             in glass mounts or fixed with adhesive labels.)             <p>         </menu>        Artist who are unable to meet these guidelines should contact the MAEP         at (612)870-3125.        <p> <b>Proposals should be mailed to:</b>        <p> MAEP/The Minneapolis Institute of Arts<br>          2400 Third Avenue South<br>          Minneapolis, MN 55404        <p> Proposals are requested at least ten days before a panel meeting so           they can be prepared for review. The Artist Panel meets every four to           six weeks (or as needed) to review proposals and ascertain the MAEP's           status. It is not uncommon for the panel to defer decisions until subsequent           meetings. The MAEP Program Coordinator will contact proposing artists           as soon as a decision regarding acceptance or rejection is made.        <p> Artists are cautioned against using friendship as a reason for defining           an exhibition group. The Artist Panel will not redefine a proposed exhibition           group; that is, it will not add or exclude artists proposed for an exhibition.        <p> The MAEP slide reference and resource library is accessible by appointment           for planning exhibition proposals. Specific questions concerning the           preparation of exhibition proposals may be directed to the MAEP at (612)           870-3125. It should be noted that neither the Program Coordinator nor           the Program Associate takes part in the selection process; they only           present materials prepared by the applicants.       </blockquote>      <hr>      <br>      <p><b><a href="maep.html">Background</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="maep_how.html">How         MAEP Works</a></b></p>      <b> <br>      </b><br>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
