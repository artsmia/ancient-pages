Terez         worked in her family's ceramic factory during the years that her brother         ran it. Written by Jennifer Lack, the story is about Terez, as a grandmother,         as she sits with her granddaughter and reads a diary entry she wrote during         her childhood. The diary entry is fictitious, but uses some descriptions         and incidents from Terez's writings. Read by Katherine Lack. <br>        (Story length is 6 minutes 51 seconds)</p>      <p align="right"><a href="hungary.ram"><img src="../images/listen.jpg" width="120" height="30"></a></p>      <hr>      These presentations require the RealAudio player.
