I am an artist. Artists have many talents.       <p>As an artist, I always want to understand how art was made. What exactly         did the artist have to do to make a work of art look the way it does?       <p>I am a creative problem-solver. I have to think about many things before         I actually begin.       <p>I have to plan. I have to consider the look, materials, function, and         cost of the piece before I create it.       <p>Art making, to me, is more than simply making something. It is a spiritual         process of self-discovery, creativity, and passion.       <p>Follow me and discover some methods artists use to create their works         of art.      <p align="right"><a href="chooser.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width="89" height="46" border="0"></a>       </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>    <td><a href="/ceramics/secondary/index.html"><img src="/ceramics/images/common/who_knows.gif" width="120" height="30"></a></td>    <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</body></html>
