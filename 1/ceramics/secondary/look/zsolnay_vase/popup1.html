And artists need to know about the chemical makeup of     materials they work with. For example, sculptors must understand how to bond     materials together so they do not fall apart under pressure, and painters     should know whether their paints and solvents are safe or need to be handled     with caution.</font></h2></blockquote><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>    <td><a href="/ceramics/secondary/index.html"><img src="/ceramics/images/common/who_knows.gif" width="120" height="30"></a></td>    <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><h2>&nbsp; </h2></body></html>
