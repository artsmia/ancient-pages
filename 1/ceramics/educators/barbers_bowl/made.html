Artisans         could use only those colors that would stand up under the high temperatures         (1000 degrees Fahrenheit) needed to set the white tin oxide glaze.

Because earthenware is         more brittle than porcelain, it cannot be potted as thinly and therefore         has a heavier, thicker appearance.       <p>Tin glaze is composed of fine sand (silica), calcined lead, and tin oxide         (ash). It is the tin oxides that make the glaze opaque and give it its         soft, luminous quality. Since tin glazes do not become highly fluid when         fired in the kiln, decoration can be applied without running or smudging.         The vessel was first dipped in, or covered with, the tin glaze and allowed         to dry. Then the decoration was painted onto the porous, absorbent surface         of the powdery ground. This required a quick but sure hand, which resulted         in the fresh, spirited style seen in this barber's bowl.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
