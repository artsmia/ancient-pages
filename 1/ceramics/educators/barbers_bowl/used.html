Steiner<br>            96.36.6</td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>This seventeenth-century English barber's bowl was once an essential         tool for a barber shaving his customers. It has a shallow basin with a         broad rim. A semicircular opening in the rim allows it to fit closely         against the neck of the person being shaved, permitting his chin to reach         over the bowl. The semicircular notch on the rim may also have been used         for resting the patient's arm during the process of bloodletting, which         was performed by barber-surgeons of the time. The small circular depression         on the side of the rim may have held a small ball of soap while the barber         lathered and shaved his customer's face. Another possibility is that the         barber placed his thumb in the cavity to get a good grip while holding         the bowl. One can only imagine that a firm grip by the barber on the wet,         soapy bowl would be a comfort to the customer in the process of being         shaved with a straight-edged razor. Many small chips and nicks along the         outer edge of the rim suggest that this object was often employed in the         shaving process. </p>      <p>The barber's bowl served another function as well. The two small holes         on the top of the rim were used to string a cord from which the bowl was         hung on the wall when not in use. The fact that it was hung on the wall         shows that this bowl was also valued for its decorativeness. Although         barber's bowls were most often made of tin-glazed earthenware, there are         examples in pewter and brass and even silver.       <p>  		<!--navmenu --> &nbsp;        <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
