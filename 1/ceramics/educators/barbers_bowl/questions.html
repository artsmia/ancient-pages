Why would           the artist include these objects as a part of the design of this bowl?           What does it tell you about the function of the bowl? How many living           creatures do you see? What kind are they? Where do you see them? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What kinds of lines do you see?

How would the barber           hold this bowl? Do you think this bowl would be heavy or light to hold?           What if your hands were wet and soapy? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How big do you think this bowl is?

Why? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> The designs on this bowl are not symmetrical, yet they appear balanced.           How have the shapes and lines been used to make the design appear balanced?           In what ways has the artist made the lines of the decoration correspond           to the shape of the bowl? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Can you tell what material was used to make this bowl? What do you           think the two small holes at the top are for? Do you think this bowl           was put away when not in use? Why or why not? <br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <h3>Think </h3>      <ol>         <li> This bowl is called a Barber's bowl. Why do you think it is called           that? What does the name tell you about the function of this bowl? Why           do you think this bowl was useful for barbers? What does a barber do?           Would barbers use a bowl like this today? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> From its appearance, do you think it was made to be used or to be           looked at? Why do you say that? What other objects in this unit are           useful and decorative? How does this bowl differ from the Hopi-Tewa           seed jar? How are they the same? Do you have anything in your home that           is beautifully decorated and also useful? Describe it. What do we use           bowls for today? What are your bowls at home made of? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> If you could design a barber's bowl, what colors would you choose?           How would it differ from this bowl? What shapes would you use? What           kinds of lines? What images would you choose to represent? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> The design of this bowl incorporates <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#motifs','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">MOTIFS</a>           from both European and Asian cultures. Which motifs do you think belong           to which culture? Why? This bowl is tin-glazed earthenware designed           to look like Chinese porcelain. Why would Europeans want to imitate           porcelain? (Porcelain was highly prized in Europe for its amazingly           thin, elegant, and translucent qualities, and the secret of porcelain           production had not yet been discovered in Europe.) What other objects           in this unit were inspired by Asian art? Do you have anything that is           made of one material but designed to look like another?
