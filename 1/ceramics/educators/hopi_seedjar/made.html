Once the clay has been         dug and transported, it must be processed. Water is used to dissolve out         minerals; other impurities such as stones, twigs, and roots are sieved         and sifted out. The clay is then mixed with <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#temper','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">TEMPER</a>&#151;usually         sand, finely ground rock, or crushed <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#potsherds','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">POTSHERDS</a>&#151;which         will ensure slow, even drying of the pots without cracking.       <p>Traditionally, women shaped pots, and men helped with mixing the clay         or with painting. Today both men and women make pots, using the hand-built         <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#coiling_method','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">COILING         METHOD</a>. Out of respect for the old ways, potters use their hands,         not machines: pottery is never <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#thrown','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">THROWN</a>         on a wheel. To begin, a base is patted out much as dough is flattened         out to make tortillas. If the pot is larger than the palm of the hand,         it is placed on a base called a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#puki','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PUKI</a>,         which is used to support the coils as they are added. A puki can be anything         that will hold the pot, from a china plate or cereal bowl to a pie tin.         After pinching a rim around the edge of the base, the maker rolls the         first coil of moist clay and adds it to the inside edge. Coils are added         one by one, as the potter turns the puki, making sure the clay remains         moist enough to adhere properly. Air bubbles are constantly kneaded out,         as they could ruin the pot when fired.       <p><a name="return_1"></a>An essential part of shaping the pot is called         scraping. Working with speed and care, the potter uses a scraper made         from a potsherd, gourd rind, or more contemporary material such as an         eyeglass lens, to thin the walls and smooth out the coil junctions. Dextra         Quotskuyva speaks of this process as the pot &quot;molding itself&quot;;         she is there &quot;to guide it the way it wants.&quot;<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup>         After the pot has dried, its final form is achieved by additional scraping         and sanding. Sanding has traditionally been done with corncobs, lava rocks,         or sandstone; today potters also use window screen, steel wool, sandpaper,         or metal tools. Minor imperfections can be smoothed out with wet clay         or a wet cloth, but pots with major flaws must be broken and recycled         with the next batch of clay.       <p>Next the potter creates a lustrous shine by carefully hand rubbing the         pot with a polishing stone or clean rag. Quotskuyva uses a polishing stone         that was her mother's. Pueblo familes often pass down objects used in         making pottery as part of their tradition. Polishing requires great skill         and concentration to avoid scratching the pot.       <p>Now the pot is ready for the last step before firing: painting. The black         paint used is a mixture of <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#guaco','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">GUACO</a>         (a residue resulting from boiling down Rocky Mountain bee plant) and tansy         mustard. The plants are also gathered with prayers and ceremonies. <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#ocher','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">OCHER</a>         or iron-rich mineral <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#pigments','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PIGMENTS</a>,         ground rock, and clay are mixed with a liquid binder to create red, brown,         and yellow paints. Brushes are made from a dried yucca leaf that has been         chewed down to a few fibers for bristles. Designs are painted on freehand         and sometimes made up as they are added.       <p><a name="return_2"></a>The potter builds an outdoor <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#kiln','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">KILN</a>         from scratch each time pots are fired. She places the pots on a grate         a few inches off the ground and stacks kindling underneath. Then she covers         the pots with broken pottery, tin, old bedsprings, or other metal pieces         to protect them from the fire. The fuel, usually cakes of sheep or cow         manure mixed with pieces of wood and bark, is stacked around the outside         and ignited. Firing is a risky part of the process; a few pots are always         ruined. Some potters make an offering before lighting the fire, or have         the ground blessed by a holy man. The potter has a sense, from experience,         of how long the fire needs to be tended and when she can let it burn down.         Overfiring can cause the pots to turn dull. Not all the pots are &quot;meant         to be.&quot; Some of them explode, or air bubbles in the clay pop. Every         potter keeps a few cracked pots in her home, believing that pots, like         people, are valuable, even when imperfect.<sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a>1.
