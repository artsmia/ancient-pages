In times of food scarcity, they were also used to store the seeds         of wild plants, which were ground up and mixed with cornmeal.       <p><a name="return_5"></a>While such pottery continues to be made for personal         and ceremonial use, or for trading among the pueblos, its function has         also fundamentally changed. Pieces once traditionally used as food and         water containers or storage vessels have become art objects, made to satisfy         the demands of non-Native American buyers who often commission specific         pieces to round out their collections. Potters have responded differently         to this market. Some feel it limits creativity, while others work to meet         commercial expectations. Dextra Quotskuyva voices her viewpoint: &quot;It's         hard to do another pot expecting it to be the way that they want their         pot to be. The pots are all different. They all have their own character.&quot;<a href="#note_5">5</a>       <p><a name="return_6"></a>Today, the Pueblo people must live in two worlds:         while they maintain and revere their ancestral traditions, they also participate         in twentieth-century America. Potters make contemporary statements by         pushing the limits of old traditions to accommodate new markets. Pottery         making bridges these separate worlds. It comes out of the old ways but         also generates income to help families survive in a free enterprise society.<a href="#note_6">6</a>      <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_5"></a><a href="#return_5">5.</a> Struever, &quot;Potter         Dextra Quotskuyva,&quot; p. 60. </p>      <p><a name="#note_6"></a><a href="#return_6">6.</a> Rick Dillingham looks         at the role of pottery making in the lives of the Pueblos in twentieth-century         America in Fourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery (Albuquerque: University         of New Mexico Press, 1994).       <p> <!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
