The jar has a minimal amount of painted design. Quotskuyva         says that sometimes &quot;that is all the pot wants, and you have to let         it go.&quot;<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup> She adds her own unique         variations to ancient patterns that originated between 1375 and 1625 at         Sikyatki (seek-YAHT-kee), an abandoned Hopi village. Sikyatki designs         inspired the <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#abstract','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ABSTRACT</a>         and <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#geometric','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">GEOMETRIC</a>         forms of the jar; its triangles, rectangles, parallel lines, and spirals         traditionally represent rain, lightening, and wind. The cluster of precisely         painted, abstract forms restricted to one shoulder complements the jar's         shape. Quotskuyva wants people to touch her pots and experience the way         they feel. This jar, like other Sikyatki shapes, almost defies the laws         of structure with its wide flattened shoulder and small opening in the         center.       <p><a name="return_4"></a>The seed jar also contains distinguishing Nampeyo         family <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#motifs','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">MOTIFS</a>,         such as <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#stylized','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">STYLIZED</a>         bird wings and feathers. Three triangular-capped feathers sweep across         the top of the jar and fan out to the left side of the design as if fancifully         blown by the wind. Farther to the right, in contrast, an angular wing         of split feathers is expressed more solidly and geometrically. Birds,         especially eagles, play an important ceremonial role in the life of the         Hopi people. The arid land of the mesas requires ample rainful to produce         the crops of corn, melons, peaches, gourds, squash, and beans that the         Hopi rely upon. They believe the spirit of the eagle carries a prayer         for rain to the gods on behalf of the people.<sup><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup>       <p>Several Hopi designs and painting methods were rediscovered in the late         1800s, when archaeologists unearthed potteries from the ruins of Sikyatki.         Nampeyo, Quotskuyva's great-grandmother, decided to reintroduce the old         Sikyatki designs found on excavated potsherds. She succeeded in reviving         the style, rediscovered old clay sources, and abandoned the use of slip         to polish the yellow clay body itself. Many Pueblo women and their families         followed her lead; they still tell stories of her teaching and influence.      <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_3"></a>3.

At the end of its watch,         the bird is sacrificed so that its spirit can soar to the heavens with         the message that all is well and the rains may continue to come.
