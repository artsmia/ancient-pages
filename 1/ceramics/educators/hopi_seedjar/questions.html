Of what material is this jar           made? How can you tell? Where does clay come from? Do the colors look           natural or artificial? Why do you say that? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How do you think the artist made this jar? This jar was made by hand           with long coils of clay. How do you think the artist made it look so           smooth? What tools might she have used? How do you think this jar would           feel if you were to touch it? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What is <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#pattern','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PATTERN</a>?           Describe the patterns you see on this jar. Where on this jar do you           see shapes or lines repeated to create patterns? How does the artist           use color to create patterns?

What skills have you learned from other people? What skills           have you taught yourself by looking at examples made by others? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> The Hopi-Tewa people continue to make pottery in the tradition of           their grandmothers and great-grandmothers. What is a tradition? Do you           have traditions in your family that you can trace back to your ancestors?           Why would it be important for people to have traditions that continue           through generations of a family? What are some ways that you think traditions           are passed from one generation to another? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Hopi-Tewa artists make and decorate pots for use and for sale to tourists.           Why would a Hopi-Tewa artist take the time to decorate a pot with traditional           designs for tourists? If you were going to buy a piece of pottery from           a culture other than your own, would it be important to you that it           look "authentic" or traditional? Why or why not? Why do you think it           would be important to an artist working today to make traditional art           of his or her culture? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What sort of containers do you and your family use to keep your food           in? What are your containers made of? Why do you think the Hopi-Tewa           used clay to make this seed jar? Why would they decorate a container           that was only used to hold seeds? What would you keep in this jar? Do           you have a special container to hold something that is important to           you? What do you keep in it? If you were going to make a special container           for yourself, how would you make and decorate it? What materials would           you use? What colors would you use? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Compare this jar to the Greek Hydria. In what ways does each work           reflect the environment of the people who made it? What do the materials           and decorations tell you about the culture from which the work came?<br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" width="225" height="20" alt="More Information">       </p>      <blockquote>         <p> <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          Discussion questions.<br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
