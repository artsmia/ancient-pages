What material is this jar made of? How           can you tell? Where does clay come from? What does clay feel like when           you begin to work with it? Is it hard or easy to form into a shape?           Why? What happens when clay is fired? Why does it have to be fired?         <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What shapes do you see?

Explain           your answer. How do you think the artist made the rim?

What would you keep in this jar? If           you were going to make a special container for yourself, how would you           make and decorate it? What materials would you use? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Compare this jar to the Hopi-Tewa seed jar. In what ways does each           work reflect the environment of the people who made it? What do the           materials and decorations tell you about the culture from which the           work came? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Does the appearance of this jar suggest that it was a special jar           to the Jomon people? Many Jomon pots had a unique design. Why would           the Jomon people want each pot to look unique?<br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" width="225" height="20" alt="More Information">       </p>      <blockquote>         <p> <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          Discussion questions.<br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td> </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
