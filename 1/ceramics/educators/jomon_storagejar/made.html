The         artist built up the vessel from a base using long coils of clay rolled         by hand, pressed together, and formed into a distinctive shape. Imaginative         handles and rims were also shaped by hand and applied at the top.       <p>Jomon potters used a coarse-textured <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#alluvial','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ALLUVIAL</a>         clay that was available near their dwelling sites. As with the Hopi-Tewa         seed jar discussed in this unit, sand or crushed stone was added as a         <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#temper','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">TEMPER</a>         to ensure that the pots dried evenly, without cracking.       <p>Jomon literally means &quot;cord markings.&quot; The name comes from         the scratchings or impressions of cord or matting which decorated the         outer surface of the vessels. The potter made the patterns on this pot         by rolling twisted cord or rope over the surface of the shaped clay. On         other pots, patterns were created with impressions of bamboo sticks, seashells,         and even fingernails.       <p>To make them more durable, unglazed Jomon wares were stacked in simple         open pits and &quot;cooked&quot; by wood fires built around and over them.         The fire was fed continuously for about an hour and then allowed to die         down. The low firing temperatures ranged from 600&deg; to 800&deg; C.         As can be seen on this jar, surfaces became marked with black spots caused         by <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#reduction','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">REDUCTION</a>,         or the lack of oxygen due to poor combustion.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
