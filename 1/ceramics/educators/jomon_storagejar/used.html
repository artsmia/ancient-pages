To suit different utilitarian and ceremonial needs, Jomon potters         produced vast quantities of large pots in many forms, including fireplace         bowls, pots for storage and cooking, lamps or incense burners, and footed         vessels. This jar was used to store harvested crops or foods gathered         from the surrounding area. Jomon pots were not used as grave offerings;         all examples have been found at dwelling sites.<sup><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup>       <p>Many pieces have unique decoration, which leads us to think that perhaps         people added original designs to make the pots recognizable as their own.         The great variety also comes from the fact that pottery was not made in         workshops; each household had at least one family member who was skilled         in ceramic production.       <p>Although the top-heavy, unstable shape seems impractical, this jar was         probably set in a hole in the dirt floor of a Jomon dwelling, making its         contents easily accessible. That would explain why only the rim has such         highly original decor.       <p>Until recently, interest in Jomon ceramic wares was limited to <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#archeological','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ARCHAEOLOGICAL</a>         study.
