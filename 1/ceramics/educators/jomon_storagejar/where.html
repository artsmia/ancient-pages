It         probably comes from central Japan, near Tokyo. The storage jar was made         during the middle years of the Jomon period, a culture that lasted from         10,500 to 300 B.C.<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup> The Jomon culture         was not only long-lived, but also widespread; evidence of its existence         has been found at over 75,000 sites. It was the first Japanese culture         to produce ceramic wares, and these were made in many different forms         and styles. Although determining precisely when the earliest Jomon vessels         were made is difficult, <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#radiocarbon_dating','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">RADIOCARBON         DATING</a> has identified pieces from as early as 10,500 B.C.<sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup>       <p><a name="return_3"></a>The Middle Jomon people migrated from the coast         to the central forested highlands as a result of a global warming trend         that melted the Ice Age glaciers and separated Japan from the mainland.         They survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing and used simple tools         of wood, bone, horn, or stone. Their production of low-fired earthenware         indicates a change from <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#nomadic','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">NOMADIC</a>         to more settled societies. Large villages consisted of pit houses with         central heating and cooking areas that emphasized the importance of family         unity. The people stored and processed the foodstuffs they gathered, and         perhaps even cultivated some of their own crops. The large number of vessels         that have been excavated from dwellings throughout Japan suggests the         people enjoyed economic stability and enough leisure time to develop crafts         that incorporated a sense of beauty.<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a><a href="#return_1">1.</a> Jomon is a modern name         introduced by the 19th-century scholar Edward S.
