Joining couples in a single work is a common feature of West         Mexican art. We know this figure is female by the vessel she holds in         her right hand and by her attire. She wears a plain headband and a long         wraparound skirt resembling a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#sarong','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SARONG</a>.         Male figures usually carry weapons or musical instruments, such as drums         or rattles. They often wear a pointed, cone-shaped headdress, a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#mantle','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">MANTLE</a>         tied with a cord over one shoulder, and short trousers with a loincloth         in front.       <p><a name="return_1"></a>Stylistically, the figure is identified with Nayarit,         the northernmost state of the shaft-tomb culture. The simple female form         evokes a mood of humor and merriment.

Instead, skinny arms contrast with thick, short         legs, and large feet projecting at the rear enable her to stand independently.         Other identifying features include an enormous nose and ears, long neck,         pointed chin, and small, carefully <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#articulated','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ARTICULATED</a>         teeth bared in a half-grin.<a href="#note_1">1</a>       <p>Both men and women wear elaborate jewelry and body markings in these         sculptures. This woman's body is adorned with ear spools with radiating         tassels of polished stone or obsidian, multiple nose rings made of shell,         an arm band, several pellets applied to her shoulder, and a protruding         <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#pectoral','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PECTORAL</a>         (probably a pendant) in the shape of a crescent. The importance of body         decoration is highlighted by the fact that most Nayarit figures wear at         least one piece of jewelry. The red color of the baked clay predominates,         with brown, white, yellow, and black painted geometric designs forming         the patterned design of the skirt.      <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a><a href="#return_1">1.</a> For stylistic descriptions         of Nayarit art, see Michael Kan, Clement Meighan, and H.
