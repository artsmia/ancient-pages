They         may have been placed in the tomb to honor or protect the dead, or to serve         as reminders of the deceased's family members in the passage to the next         life. Before burial, the works may have functioned as architectural or         religious sculptures, displayed in front of buildings or inside homes         and shrines. Ritual practices associated with the figures may have centered         on a cult of the dead or a type of ancestor worship.
