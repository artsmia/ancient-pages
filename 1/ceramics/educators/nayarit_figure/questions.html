Where does clay come from? When you           work with clay, is it soft or hard? How does it get hard? Baking or           firing clay makes it last a long time. How do you think the artist shaped           this figure? Pretend you have a ball of clay in your hands. Move your           hands to show how you would shape the feet; the legs; the face; the           body. Can you tell what parts have been added on in clay? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Look closely at this woman's face. Can you make the same expression?           Do you think she is happy? Sad? Sleepy? Funny? What adjectives would           you use to describe her? What jewelry is she wearing? Where do you see           the jewelry? How would her earrings feel if you could try them on? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Does this look like a real person? Do you think this is a male or           a female figure? Why do you say that? Which features has the artist           exaggerated or emphasized? Why do you think the artist did this? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How did the artist decorate the figure? Where do you see painted patterns?           Where do you see a rectangle in this figure? A triangle? A square? What           is she holding?<br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What is this figure wearing? Does she have a hat? Does she wear shoes?           Based on her clothing, what do you think the climate was like where           she lived? What has she done to decorate her body? Do you think body           decoration was important to the Nayarit people? <br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <h3>Think<br>      </h3>      <ol>         <li> Why do you think this is called a tomb figure? Why do you think people           would want objects buried with them? Objects people placed in their           tombs provide clues to their everyday life. What do you think this woman's           life was like? Why do you say that? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Do you think this figure was difficult to make? Why do you think so?         <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What other objects in this unit have been included in a tomb? All           used clay for works of art. Which culture(s) do you think was more advanced           in its ceramics techniques? Why? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Describe what an archaeologist does. (Digging up things buried long           ago and searching for clues to how people used to live.) What would           you bury in a time capsule that would show people in the future about           your life? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Even though this woman is standing still, she looks lively. How did           the artist convey that liveliness? Is it shown in her face? In her body?           Cover the body and look at the head. Cover the head and look at the           body. How did the artist make the face so expressive? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> After firing, the artist painted this figure with patterned fabrics,           facial decoration, and jewelry in white, red, yellow, and black mineral           and vegetable <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#pigments','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PIGMENTS</a>.           You may see some traces of the paint still on the figure, but most of           it has worn off or faded over time because it was not baked on in the           firing process. Do you think it is possible to appreciate the figure           as a work of art even though we can not see it as the artist originally           intended it to appear? If you were the curator of the museum's Art of           the Americas gallery, would you display this figure as it is, or would           you attempt to repaint the figure in order to display it as the artist           intended?
