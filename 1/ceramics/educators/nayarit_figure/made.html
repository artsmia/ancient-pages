The elaborate methods of decoration, large scale, expressiveness,         and spontaneity in the handling of the clay all suggest that such pieces         were made by trained craftspeople. To make this female figure, the artist         first rolled out a large slab of clay and draped it over a convex mold         to form a large, hollow torso. Then two long, thin ropes of clay were         rolled between the hands and attached to her body. Massive elephant-like         legs were modeled and huge toes carved out on each foot. A thick, plain         headband was shaped and placed around her forehead, while a flattened         sheet of clay provided a long wraparound skirt.       <p>Another noteworthy aspect of the figure is her carefully detailed jewelry.         The artist formed and applied numerous small half-circles of clay by hand         to represent the polished stones or <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#obsidian','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">OBSIDIAN</a>         of her fanlike earrings. <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#incised','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">INCISED</a>         lines mark the multiple shells of the nose rings.       <p>West Mexican pottery figures are all low-fired, porous <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#earthenware','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">EARTHENWARE</a>.         They were dried and then baked on or near an open flame, or in simply         constructed open kilns, to make the clay harder and stronger.

Some colors have         worn off or faded over time because they were not baked on in the firing         process.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
