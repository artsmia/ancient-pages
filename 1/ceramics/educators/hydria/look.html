Because the Greeks thought of their gods and goddesses         as having human characteristics and emotions, it is almost impossible         to tell the difference between the gods and humans in this scene. However,         certain <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#attributes','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ATTRIBUTES</a>         identified the most popular figures to the Greeks familiar with their         stories. <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#athena','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ATHENA</a>         (a-THEE-na) appears at the far left in her role as the goddess of war,         wearing full armor: plumed helmet, spear, and breastplate. As attendants         harness her horses she prepares to set off in her chariot. Standing in         the center of the scene, facing Athena, is <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#herakles','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">HERAKLES</a>         (HAIR-a-kleez), with a red beard and the short curly hair of an athlete.         The figure on his right is <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#hermes','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">HERMES</a>         (HER-meez), who is identified by his pointed traveling hat, long red beard,         and a traveling staff which he carries in his left hand. In the lower         band of decoration, wild boars and snarling lions, associated with two         of the twelve labors of Herakles, combat one another. In the band above,         Athena and Herakles are engaged in an equally aggressive battle with <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#kyknos','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">KYKNOS</a>         (KEEK-nos). <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#zeus','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ZEUS</a>         (zoose) stands between them with his arms outstretched in an attempt to         intervene.       <p>Stylistically, the hydria demonstrates the characteristics of black-figure         ware produced during the late sixth century B.C. Vase painters typically         colored all women's skin white and the men's reddish brown. The human         body is shown in profile or in combinations of <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#frontal','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">FRONTAL</a>         and profile views. For example, we see Athena and the horses strictly         from the side, but Herakles' torso is shown from the front and his head         is shown in profile. A sense of depth is achieved by the overlapping of         figures. Notice how the horses overlap each other and in turn overlap         some of the male figures, including Herakles and Hermes. The clothing         is indicated by stylized patterns of line and shape.       <p>This hydria exemplifies the qualities of harmony and <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#symmetry','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYMMETRY</a>,         highly prized by the Greeks. The orderly designs conform to the different         parts of the vase and accentuate its well-balanced, harmonious proportions.         The largest figures are on the main body of the pot, while smaller figures         decorate the shoulder. Various designs complement other parts. For example,         a circle of tongue <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#motifs','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">MOTIFS</a>         (moe-TEEFS) decorates the base of the vase and emphasizes its function         as the support of the whole vessel. A circle of rays rises out of the         base and draws attention to the paintings on the main body.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          What does it look like?<br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
