Relying on trade         and farming, Greece was dominated by small independent city-states, such         as Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. Pottery making was the first major industry         to develop in Athens. Greek pots were made in a wide variety of shapes         and sizes for both the local market and export. During this rich period         the Greeks also adopted the Phoenician alphabet, built many classical         monuments (such as the Parthenon on the Acropolis), and codified laws         guaranteeing the rights of citizens.       <p>We know the artist of this hydria only as the Antimenes (an-TIM- en-eez)         Painter. Although many vase painters did not sign their work, art historians         can identify them by stylistic traits that recur in their paintings. The         Antimenes Painter was the head of a large workshop and probably painted         hundreds of vases. His workshop was known for images of harnessing horses         such as the one on this vase. In most cases, two different artists worked         on the pots. The potter formed the pot, and the painter decorated it.         So, it is likely that another member of the Antimenes workshop was responsible         for forming the vase.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          Where does it come from?<br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
