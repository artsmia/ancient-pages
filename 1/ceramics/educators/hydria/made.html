The potter's wheel used in ancient Greece consisted         of a turntable, on which the clay was placed, and a disk or crank that         the potter operated with his knee to keep the turntable moving. This technique         left both hands free to form the pot from the clay as the turntable turned.         Large pots such as the hydria were made in sections, which were joined         together with <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#slip','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SLIP</a>.         Sections were defined at the structural joints&#151;between the neck and         body or the foot and body. Thin coils of clay added on the outside concealed         the marks where the parts were joined. Handles were made by hand and attached         with slip.       <p>Athenian potters used a high-quality clay that turned a beautiful reddish         brown when fired. They discovered, through a complex procedure, that a         pot could be fired to produce both this natural red-orange color and black.         The painting style that resulted is called black-figure because the figures         are rendered in black against the natural red of the clay. To create the         figures, the artist painted on the surface of the vase with a thickened         clay and water mixture called <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#engobe','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ENGOBE</a>         (on-GOBE). Once the engobe was applied and dried, the pot was placed in         a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#kiln','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">KILN</a>         and fired for many hours.       <p>The figures became black through a process called <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#oxidation','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">OXIDATION</a>         and <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#reduction','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">REDUCTION</a>         firing, which consists of three stages. During the first stage, oxygen         is let into the kiln, causing the entire vase to turn red from the iron         content of the clay. During the second stage the oxygen supply is cut         off, causing the entire vase to turn black. During the third and final         stage, oxygen is let back into the kiln, causing the vase to return to         its original red color. However, because the engobe has a different consistency         from the rest of the vase, the decorated portions do not reabsorb oxygen         and they remain black.       <p>Details were <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#incised','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">INCISED</a>         in the black areas before firing by scraping through to the red clay with         a sharp tool. For example, the lines that show details in the faces and         clothing are all incised lines. Finally, accents of white and purple were         applied with separate solutions after firing. On this hydria traces of         white remain on Athena's face, and purple appears on the horses' manes.         More colors were probably once present, but they have disappeared over         time.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
