The first         land-based steam engine was installed in 1807, allowing the emergence         of the modern factory and large-scale production of ceramic goods. With         the introduction of automation, pottery wheels were driven by belts and         powered by steam engines, greatly increasing the efficiency of ceramic         production.       <p>Gustavsberg was one of only two manufacturers of porcelain in Sweden         in the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, most porcelain goods         were imported from China. By the end of the nineteenth century, however,         Swedish factories were producing quality porcelains using varying amounts         of a white clay called <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#kaolin','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">KAOLIN</a>,         the most essential ingredient.       <p><a name="return_1"></a>Although many pieces were made in molds, vases         and jars were <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#thrown','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">THROWN</a>         on a potter's wheel. To perfect the final shape, the potter held a wood         or porcelain mold against the inside of the jar while following the outside         with his other hand. Faults were smoothed out on a turning lathe after         the piece was partially dry. When completely dry, it was polished, placed         in a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#sagger','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SAGGER</a>         (a protective clay box), and fired in a kiln. The temperature for firing         varied with the quality of the porcelain; the higher the temperature,         the greater the porcelain's strength and impermeability. After the first         firing, the jar was decorated and <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#glazed','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">GLAZED</a>,         according to the dictates of the designer, and then fired a second time.         Some designs were mass produced using stencils or templates. Glaze &quot;recipes&quot;         were developed to produce consistent, specific colors.<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup>         The Gustavsberg factory became famous for the matte green glaze and <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#sgraffito','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SGRAFFITO</a>         decoration found on this covered jar. Sgraffito is achieved by overlaying         the clay body with a thin layer of glaze or SLIP in a contrasting or darker         color; then the overlayer is partially scraped away to form a pattern         and reveal the color beneath. When the object is fired, the pattern is         slightly raised from the surface.
