Beauty was seen not as a luxury, but as a necessity that ennobled         people and deepened their experience. Beautiful surroundings caused one         to work better and to feel better. Although some artists worked toward         this end, most Art Nouveau objects, such as this covered jar, were too         expensive for many people. Improvements in glazes and design were more         likely to be applied to decorative than to <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#utilitarian','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">UTILITARIAN</a>         ceramics. Useful pottery, rarely a work of art, was for the most part         plainer and less beautiful. The middle and lower classes generally bought         inexpensive, serial imitations of what the wealthy favored. Most Art Nouveau         pieces remained purely decorative--available only as expensive, exclusive         items purchased by those of above-average means. </p>      <p>  		<!--navmenu --> &nbsp;        <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
