Long-stemmed blossoms and nodules reduced to         simplified shapes spread over the swelling shoulder and the top of the         lid, while long, intertwined leaves dance around the jar's body. The design         is characteristic of Art Nouveau, which was brought to Sweden in 1897         and remained popular until about 1905. This movement took its inspiration         from graceful plant and animal forms. In Sweden, <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#nationalist','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">NATIONALIST</a>         pride prompted the use of designs based on native flora and fauna.       <p>Art Nouveau's emphasis on nature was a reaction to the problems of the         city--crowded housing, air pollution, increased commercialism- -which         caused people to long for a simpler, pastoral time. Romantic themes based         on nostalgia for the past and the pleasures of the countryside characterized         the art and literature of the period. Further inspiration came from Japanese         prints that incorporated natural forms and landscape. These prints became         the rage in fashionable society after U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry visited         Japan in 1854 and trade treaties were signed that brought Japanese goods         to the West.       <p><a name="return_2"></a>Art Nouveau also grew out of an interest in new         scientific discoveries, illustrated scientific books, and biological research         such as Darwin's study of evolution, published in The Origin of Species         in 1859. Artists saw the vigorous growth and attractive movement of plants         as themes, not merely <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#ornamental','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ORNAMENTAL</a>         effects.

It represented what         was new and modern in an effort to reject Old World historical styles.         It has been called &quot;the first movement to recognize the demands of         the modern world,&quot; whose goal was to &quot;achieve harmony between         the object and its decoration.&quot;<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_2"></a><a href="#return_2">2.</a> Siegrid Wichmann, Jugendstil         Art Nouveau: Floral and Functional Forms, trans.
