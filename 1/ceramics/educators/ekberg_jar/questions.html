Who would you consider the artist,           the designer of the object or the factory worker(s) who made the jar,           or both? Explain your answer. <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> This design is based on a flower native to Sweden. If you were to           design a ceramic object in the Art Nouveau style, what plant or animal           form would you base your design on? Why? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> This design was influenced by Japanese prints that incorporated natural           forms and landscapes What other object in this unit was inspired by           Asian works of art? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Why would wealthy people want this object in their house?

In what ways has the artist attempted to imitate           natural forms? In what ways has the artist abstracted or stylized the           forms? How are the designs on this piece different from those on the           Zsolnay vase? How are they the same? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What colors do you see? Why do you think the artist chose to use these           colors? Would the jar look different if it had been decorated with many           colors?
