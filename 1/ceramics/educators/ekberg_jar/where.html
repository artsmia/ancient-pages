Founded in 1827, the factory employed 900 workers         by 1900 and produced a wide variety of porcelain, stoneware, and tin-glazed         earthenware. It became an important center for the development of Swedish         ceramics. Gunnar Wennerberg, whose name appears on the jar's base, was         the factory's artistic director between 1897 and 1908. Josef Ekberg created         many designs for Gustavsberg from 1897 until his death in 1945. His initials         are lightly <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#incised','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">INCISED</a>         near the edge of the base. Made in 1899, the jar is one of Ekberg's early         works for the factory.       <p>In the late 1800s, with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution, the         Swedish economy grew rapidly. A new upper class of industrial leaders,         bankers, and merchants increased the demand for factory- made goods and         services. In the wealthier parts of the city, the upper class lived in         stylish apartments, which they could afford to decorate lavishly with         the new products of the arts and crafts industries. But problems of housing         shortages, high rents, and unsuitable housing conditions also proliferated,         as hundreds of thousands of people moved from rural, agricultural areas         to find jobs in the booming cities.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          Where does it come from?<br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
