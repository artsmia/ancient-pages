This style is characterized by long, elegant curves. Where           do you see long, elegant curves in the design and shape of this vase?           What effect do all these curved lines have on the overall feeling of           the vase? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How would you describe the colors on this vase? Warm? Cool? Shiny?           Dull? Are these colors that appear in nature? The rich ruby-red luster           is the most difficult color to achieve in a ceramic glaze. Point to           where you see this red. <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What scene is depicted? What time of day do you think is suggested?           Why do you think that? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What words would you use to describe the design? Calm? Busy? Active?           Peaceful? Flowing? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Do you think this vase was made (a) on a potter's wheel, (b) using           the coil method, (c) with a mold, or (d) by the slab method? Explain           your answer. How do you think the person who made this vase applied the           decoration? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Is the design on this vase <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#symmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYMMETRICAL</a>           or <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#asymmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ASYMMETRICAL</a>?           Explain your answer.

What does this tell           you about how the artist wanted you to view this vase? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> This design achieves a balance between nature and imagination. How           would this vase look if the artist believed nature was more important           than imagination? What would it look like if imagination had played           a more important role? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Color, line, and form have musical qualities and convey a sense of           rhythm and harmony. What kind of music does this design make you think           of? Jazz? Opera? Country? Classical? Explain your answer. How would           you represent your favorite music? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How do you think this object was used? Would it be for everyday use           or for display? Why?
