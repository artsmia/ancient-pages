The technique         had been used prior to the seventeenth century in creating Islamic, Spanish,         and Italian majolica but was subsequently lost. The refound glazes were         the result of Zsolnay's lengthy scientific experimentation in collaboration         with Vince Wartha, a chemistry professor at the Technical University of         Budapest.       <p>In this process, after two firings, the surface of the pottery is painted         with a compound of silver or copper oxide and then fired a third time         at a lower temperature.

The resulting <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#reduction','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">REDUCTION</a>         causes the oxides to partially crystallize and leave a thin layer of metallic         deposits on the surface of the vessels. After cleaning, silver oxide produces         an <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#iridescent','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">IRIDESCENT</a>         yellow-gold luster, while red to warm golden-brown tones result from the         copper oxide.       <p><a name="return_2"></a>The brilliant Eosin, or &quot;sunrise,&quot; glaze         used on this vase was first developed in 1893 and became Zsolnay's most         innovative, celebrated technical accomplishment. A rich ruby-red luster         was the most difficult color to achieve. Iridescent colors, like metallic         red Eosin and deep blue Labrador, established Zsolnay as a leader in the         production of art pottery. Critics who viewed these works at the international         expositions recognized an Oriental influence that evoked the rich, shimmering         colors of Byzantine and Turkish art.<sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup> The complexity         of these glazes has made them difficult to define technically today.       <p>Many Zsolnay pieces were one-of-a-kind art objects. In cases where multiple         copies were made, artists prepared colored design sheets and skilled artisans         executed the designs on the vessels.       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b> </p>      <p><a name="note_2"></a><a href="#return_2"> 2.</a> Alfredo Melani, &quot;Hungarian         Art at the Milan Exhibition,&quot; International Studio 29, no. 116 (October         1906), p. 306.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
