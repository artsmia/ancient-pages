The continuous scene on the sides and mouth illustrates         the blend of influences. Abstracted tree branches spread across a vibrant         purple and gold sky, and a medieval fortress perches on the side of a         rock. The fortress may be a reference to the church towers of P&eacute;cs.         Zsolnay's trademark of five towers also recalls the five medieval churches         located there.

The birds are similar to ones found embroidered         on aprons and other garments worn by peasant women in remote Hungarian         villages at the time the vase was made. Artists recorded and studied such         motifs from native handcrafts in a search for continuity with the past.<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a>         </sup>       <p><a name="return_4"></a>Art Nouveau came later to Hungary than to the         rest of Europe but found fertile ground there. It blended easily with         a centuries-old tradition of carved and decorated houses, heavily embroidered         clothing, and highly decorative articles for everyday use. This identification         with the past played an important role in the development of a style that         blended folk art and legend, the romanticism of central Europe, Far Eastern         art, and Western European and American forms.<sup><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup>      <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_3"></a> <a href="#return_3">3.</a> Interest shifted to         native handcrafts and themes when the rapid growth of international industrial         production threatened their survival.
