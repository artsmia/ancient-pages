This figurine would have been set on the deceased's chest         or arms. It may have been a likeness of the person or represented his         social position. A great variety of people were represented in these lifelike         forms, including dignitaries, rulers, ballplayers, armed warriors, priests,         weavers, dancers, couples, and deities.       <p>The dignitary figure is hollow and perforated on the back and shoulder.         It can be blown like a whistle and therefore functions as a musical instrument.         Perhaps it was used in ceremonies performed for the dead.       <p>These miniature clay sculptures tell a visual story of the appearance         and activities of the people who made and used them. They have revealed         more about the life, customs, and practices of the ancient Maya than any         other artifacts available today.      <p>  		<!--navmenu --> &nbsp;        <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
