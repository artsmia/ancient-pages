What does the figure's pose tell you           about him? Does he appear calm and relaxed or tense and ready to move?           Does it look like a real person? Why do you say that? Is this figure           <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#symmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYMMETRICAL</a>           or <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#asymmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ASYMMETRICAL</a>?           What effect does this kind of balance create?

Why do you think so? The Maya admired a certain type           of profile. What is the shape of this man's head? How do you think it           got that way? Where do you see color on this figure? What color do you           see? What would be different about this figure's appearance if it were           still fully colored? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What is this figure wearing?

Why do you think people           would want objects buried with them? If you could bring one object into           an afterlife or eternity, what would you bring? Why would you choose           that? What purpose would it serve? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Why do you think the artist made this portrait sculpture a whistle?           When do you think this object was used as a whistle? How do you think           this whistle would sound when blown? Have you been a part of special           occasions where music is included? Have you ever blown a whistle? What           did the whistle look and sound like? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Pretend you are an archaeologist who discovered this whistle. What           clues does it give you about the Mayan people? Do you think that everyone           in this culture was buried with objects? Why or why not? Do you think           everyone would be buried with the same objects? Why or why not? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What other objects in this unit were made for a tomb?
