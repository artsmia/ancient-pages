He stands with his arms crossed         and legs spread apart, assuming a pose of power and influence. He is dressed         in a wide belt and long apron, a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#ceremonial','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">CEREMONIAL</a>         garment originated by the Mayas' predecessors.

This compact figure was made to be viewed from the         front, with both sides of the body equally distributed to either side         of center. This <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#symmetry','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYMMETRY</a>         creates a very stable, balanced form, which suits the image of power portrayed.         People rotating or in movement with full gestures are also common. These         figurines emphasize human qualities that are usually absent in other forms         of Mayan art.       <p><a name="return_4"></a>Unlike the <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#stylized','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">STYLIZED</a>         Nigerian shrine head in this unit, the fine, expressive face of the dignitary         appears to be an actual portrait. The man has the broad, flat forehead         and distinctive nose typical of the Maya. To achieve this facial type,         the Maya practiced a custom of deforming the skull by binding the heads         of infants before they were one week old. They placed two smooth, tightly         bound boards on the forehead and back, forcing the head to grow upward         and changing its contour from round to long. This resulted in a continuous         line from the top of the head to the tip of the nose, interrupted only         by the characteristic high bridge of the Mayan nose. For further emphasis,         both men and women of high status wore long hair in elaborate styles and         headdresses in the shape of animal heads, birds, or flowers. Sprays of         precious feathers were also added for decorative effect.<sup><a href="#note_4">4</a>         </sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p> <a name="note_4"></a><a href="#return_4"> 4.</a> Smith, Mexico: A History         in Art, p. 87. </p>      <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          What does it look like?<br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
