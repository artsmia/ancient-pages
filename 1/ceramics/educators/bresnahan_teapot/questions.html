How can you tell? What would this object be used           for? What material is this teapot made of? What makes you think so?           What material is the teapot's handle made of? Why do you think the teapot's           handle isn't made of clay? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What kinds of lines do you see in this teapot? Are the lines straight           or curved? Thick or thin? Use your finger to trace the lines in the           air. What kind of movement does your hand make? What mood or feeling           does the movement of the lines help create? Why do you think the artist           used so many curved lines in this teapot? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What shapes do you find in this teapot? Are they <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#organic','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ORGANIC</a>           or <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#geometric','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">GEOMETRIC</a>           shapes?

How do you think this teapot would feel if you touched           it? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> The teapot was fired in the Tanegashima, or third and largest chamber,           of a special wood-firing kiln. The pottery here is unglazed. Do the           colors look natural or artificial? What makes you think so? Would the           teapot look different if it had been glazed with colors? How? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Do you think this teapot was made (a) on a potter's wheel, (b) using           the coil method, (c) with a mold, or (d) by the slab method.

Why?           Do you think an object can be used daily and still be considered an           art object? Look around your classroom. Name several objects that are           useful. Think of the objects you have at home that are useful. If you           could make any object in your classroom or home decorative, which object           would you choose? Why? How would you change it to make it decorative?         <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Do you have a teapot at home? Is your teapot made of clay or some           other material? Was it made by hand? Where was it made? What other beverages           do people drink today? What kinds of containers hold these beverages?           What kinds of containers do you and your family use to keep liquids           in? What are your containers made of? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Where does clay come from? The artist who made this teapot is committed           to using resources and recycled materials from the surrounding area.           He respects the earth and is thankful for its many gifts. Are there           any gifts of the earth for which you are thankful? What are they? How           do you show your appreciation for the earth? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Richard Bresnahan, the artist, makes pottery that incorporates American           and Japanese traditions. He is an American who studied pottery in Japan           for four years. Was this teapot made a few years ago or a long time           ago? Why do you think so? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Have you ever made anything from clay? What did you make? How did           you do it? This teapot was thrown on a potter's wheel. Have you ever           used a potter's wheel? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Would you like to use this teapot? Do you think it would be heavy?           What sounds would you hear as you poured the tea? <br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" width="225" height="20" alt="More Information">       </p>      <blockquote>         <p> <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          Discussion questions.<br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
