Several factors have influenced why the teapot looks the way         it does.       <p>Most important, the form of the teapot serves its function. Its balloon-shaped         body helps prevent bitterness in the brewing of the tea leaves, assuring         a well-made cup of tea. Bresnahan threw the two parts of the pot separately         on a wheel and then joined them together. He chose this unusual double-gourd         shape, a variation on a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#pacific_rim','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PACIFIC         RIM</a> form, primarily for the pleasant, gurgling sounds created when         liquids are poured from it. Because the handle is usually the first part         of a pot to break off (witness all the broken handles on ancient pottery),         Bresnahan wanted to eliminate this problem. He collaborated with artist         Paul Krueger to create a handle that allowed for greater structural integrity.         Krueger experiments with different textures, colors, and weaving patterns         for each of Bresnahan's teapot forms. The <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#synergy','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYNERGY</a>         of two artists using two very different media--hard, fired clay and flexible         reeds--has produced a pot with beauty, strength, and functionality beyond         the capability of its materials if used separately.       <p><a name="return_4"></a>Unlike glazed ware, which has a glassy, hard surface,         this teapot has a warm, soft surface texture with flashes of rich color         produced by the Tanegashima firing process. Bresnahan delights in the         color possibilities of wood-fired pottery. In a world inundated with precisely         named, manufactured chemical dyes, he prefers the &quot;spirit of the         color&quot; created through this natural process.<sup><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_4"></a><a href="#return_4">4.</a> Louise Allison Cort and         Malcolm Wright, &quot;The Peters Valley Woodfire Conference,&quot; Studio         Potter 12, no. 2 (June 1984), pp. 81- 88. </p>      <h3><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </h3>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          What does it look like?<br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
