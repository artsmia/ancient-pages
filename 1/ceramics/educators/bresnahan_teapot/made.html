His         philosophy corresponds both with a Japanese sensitivity to nature and         the commitment of Benedictine monks to preserve natural resources through         the judicious use of native, renewable materials. The clay he uses was         excavated from a nearby road construction site where it had washed across         and blocked a roadway. Instead of being discarded, eighteen thousand tons         of clay were moved onto the grounds of the university and will provide         resources for making pots for the next hundred-plus years.

It is fueled         by deadfall from trees on the monastery's grounds and waste wood from         local manufacturers. Modeled after an ancient <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#tunnel_kiln','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">TUNNEL         KILN</a> used in Japan in the twelfth century, the new kiln's design and         construction combine information Bresnahan learned from direct observation         in Japan with his own theories about wood-firing. He named the kiln &quot;Johanna&quot;         after his teacher Sister Johanna Becker, a scholar of Japanese art and         ceramic specialist at St. John's, who strongly influenced his decision         to become a potter.<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup>       <p>The kiln has four chambers, each serving a distinctly different purpose.         The front chamber, where the fire is built and stoked, is for producing         natural glazing. Ash from the wood bark is deposited on the pots, melts         in the intense heat, and fuses with the <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#silica','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SILICA</a>         in the clay to form colorful, shimmering patterns. The second chamber,         cooler than the first, contains pieces covered with glazes made from the         ashes of local waste materials such as sunflower hulls or navy bean straw.       <p><a name="return_2"></a>The teapot was fired in the Tanegashima, or third         and largest chamber, which duplicates a relatively new process first created         in kilns on Tanegashima Island, off the coast of Japan. The pottery here         is unglazed, as in the first chamber. But the results are quite different.         Three channels in the floor introduce water into the kiln at high temperatures,         which increases <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#oxidation','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">OXIDATION</a>.         This produces patterns with wide color variations, from soft blacks to         vibrant reds, oranges, browns, and blues. The key to achieving the rich,         dramatic range of Tanegashima colors lies in the fourth underground kiln         chamber, which contains no pots at all.

A         successful firing is not determined by where the pots are placed in the         kiln; rather, the secret lies in &quot;where the pots are not.&quot;<sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup>       <p><a name="return_3"></a>This pot comes out of the first firing of the         specially designed kiln in October 1995. Twenty-one people worked in shifts         around the clock for nine days to satisfy the needs of this fire-beathing         &quot;dragon.&quot; The kiln reached internal temperatures of over 2500         degrees Fahrenheit; at this extreme, common clay is among an exclusive         group of heat-resistant earthly compounds that can hold together. The         teapot was among eight thousand works fired. Bresnahan's understanding         of the potential of the wood-burning kiln, his creative and technical         expertise, and the unpredictability of some aspects of the process all         combined to produce works of dramatic and subtle beauty.<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a><a href="#return_1">1.</a> Matthew Welch, &quot;Out         of the Fire,&quot; Arts Magazine, April 1996, pp. 8-9. </p>      <p><a name="note_2"></a><a href="#return_2">2.</a> Richard Bresnahan, &quot;First         Fire,&quot; Studio Potter 24, no. 2 (June 1996), pp. 50-53.       <p><a name="note_3"></a><a href="#return_3">3.</a> For an excellent description         of the process involved in firing a wood-burning kiln, see Barry Lopez,         &quot;Before the Temple of Fire,&quot; Harper's Magazine, January 1998,         pp. 35-50.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
