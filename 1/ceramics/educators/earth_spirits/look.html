Popular beliefs of the period explain that these         figures had the ability to keep evil spirits penned in one place and therefore         would have protected the grave site where they were buried.       <p>These threatening and intimidating figures blend a feline body with the         horns and hooves of a deer, a ferocious head, flaring wings, and flamelike         projections. Both figures sit on rock-shaped pedestals decorated with         elaborate drip patterns in blue, amber, and white. One beast has an unglazed         human face with enormous ears, while the other has a colorful feline face.         Where pairs of these figures have survived, the head of the human-faced         figure is always left unglazed, and its feline counterpart is completely         glazed over. The unglazed human face would originally have been decorated         with lifelike colors painted directly on the coating of white slip. Because         these colored pigments were not baked on during the firing process, they         have faded with time. Even so, these figures convey a power and splendor         that clearly reflect the imagination of the artists and their high degree         of technical skill.       <h3><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </h3>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          What does it look like?<br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
