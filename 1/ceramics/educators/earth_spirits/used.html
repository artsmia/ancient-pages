These burial sculptures,         called ming ch'i (ming-chee) or "spirit articles," were placed in tombs         to accompany and protect the dead in the afterlife. The greatest number         of sculptures were made during the early Tang. In fact, a special imperial         government office was created for the production and supervision of ming         ch'i.       <p><a name="return_1"></a>Funeral processions at this time were extravagant         and festive occasions. An ancient chronicler explains that the dead were         accompanied to their graves by great crowds who were entertained, in tents         and pavilions along the route, with food, wine, actors, acrobats, and         women.<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup> Some families were faced with         financial disaster in efforts to compete with their neighbors. Eventually,         an imperial decree issued in A.D. 742 set limits on the size and number         of tomb pieces allowed, according to the rank of the deceased. For example,         dignitaries of high rank were allowed up to seventy pottery figures, while         commoners were permitted fifteen.<sup><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a><a href="#return_1">1.</a> Mario Prodan, The Art         of the T'ang Potter (London: Thames and Hudson, 1960), p. 64. </p>      <p><a name="note_2"></a><a href="#return_1">2.</a> Robert Jacobsen, &quot;Ceramic         Tomb Sets of Early Tang,&quot; The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Bulletin         64 (1978-80), p. 21.       <p> <!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
