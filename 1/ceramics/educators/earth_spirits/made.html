The figures were made in a two-part mold and then joined together         with a clay <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#slip','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SLIP</a>         at the arms and legs. The heads were made in a separate pair of molds         and set into the bodies. The same general principles of construction were         followed in making animals and large-scale figures such as these, although         the number of molds required was greater. By using molds, Chinese potters         were able to create large-scale, three-dimensional pieces that were hollow,         which prevented them from exploding in the kiln during firing. Molds also         permitted the potters to satisfy the substantial commercial demand for         burial sculpture. All works still had to be finished by hand, however,         which allowed for greater detail and individual expression despite the         mass quantities made.       <p>After the mold was completed, most tomb pieces, such as these earth spirits,         were completely covered with a white slip. This process kept the iron         content of the clay from discoloring the glazes, which were added next,         and gave the colors a clearer, brighter quality. The colored glazes most         often used were green, amber, and yellow, although the potter was not         limited to these three colors, as these figures show. The colors were         formed by adding iron, manganese, or copper to a clear lead glaze. Occasionally,         rare and costly blue glazes were also applied. The blue coloring agent         was cobalt, a highly sought-after import item first brought into China         from the Middle East during this period. The scarcity of this fourth color         suggests that it was usually reserved for the best and most striking pieces.         The lavish use of the cobalt blue glaze on these figures indicates that         they were commissioned by a wealthy family who could afford the rare and         costly material. During the firing process, the lead glazes would run         and streak, resulting in the luxuriously blended splashes and drips of         color that typify Tang ceramics.       <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          How was it made?<br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
