Although porous, when fired it increases in strength and can hold         liquids without returning to its <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#plastic','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">PLASTIC</a>         state.       <p>Terra-cotta is composed of sedimentary earth containing organic and mineral         substances that give it a characteristic reddish brown color. <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#iron_oxide','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">IRON         OXIDE</a> produces this distinctive color when the clay is fired in an         oxygen-rich atmosphere. The color is also affected by other minerals present         and by the firing temperature. Ife pieces were most likely fired in an         open wood fire. It required great skill to control the temperature and         make the firing even, to prevent dark patches from forming on the object.         The final color ranged from dark brown to orange, buff, tan, or pink.         Ife shrine heads were most likely painted as well; traces of pigment can         often be found on parts of the face and neck.       <p><a name="return_3"></a>The use of fired clay for making vessels probably         began in Africa, where terra-cotta pottery has been found dating from         the eighth millennium B.C.
