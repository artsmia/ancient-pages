According         to tradition, life and civilization began for the Yoruba people in the         ancient city of Ile-Ife.<a href="#note_1">1</a> Ife remained the Yoruba         religious and political center until the fifteenth century. The rich folklore         of the people served as a point of unity for a region of diverse city-states         that often warred against one another for control.<a href="#note_2">2</a>       <p>Because the Yoruba city-states were often at war, they began to form         enclosed settlements for defensive purposes before the thirteenth century.         Densely populated cities surrounded by agricultural lands became characteristic         of Yoruba civilization. City walls and gates and a protected, settled         population fostered the development of terra-cotta sculpture and other         crafts that expressed the prosperity and importance of Ife. From life-size         figures to very small figurines, Ife terra-cottas took the form of freestanding         heads, animals, figure-shaped vessels, and many other subjects.       <p>Very little archaeological data exist to teach us about Ife culture and         the origins of its art. Other heads have been found that were made from         brass imported from North Africa or Europe. Because of its great cost,         however, brass was most likely cast only by authority of the king and         used for royal ceremonies. Persons of elite status may have used terra-cotta         images in rituals instead. Of the shrine heads that have been excavated,         terra-cotta sculptures are more numerous than metal castings.       <p>The Yoruba people still settle in populous urban centers, with various         family groups living in areas surrounding the compound of a chief or the         palace of a king.
