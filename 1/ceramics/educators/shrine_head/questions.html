Does it look like the head of a real           person? Why or why not? Is this a <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#naturalistic','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">NATURALISTIC</a>           or an <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#abstract','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ABSTRACT</a>           portrait? Why do you say that? What can you say about her facial expression?           How would you describe this woman? Calm? Happy? Gentle? Lively? Sleepy?           Confused? Sad? Support your answer with evidence from the work. If this           woman talked to you, how would she sound? What might she say? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What is this work made of? How can you tell? Where do you think the           artist found the material? This head was made a long time ago in the           African Yoruba kingdom of Ife, an area now part of southwestern Nigeria.           Look up Nigeria on the map. Terra-cotta pottery was probably first made           in Africa. <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Describe this woman's hairstyle. This woman wears her hair in several           ridges, a style that proclaims her high status. Would such a hairstyle           require time and skill? How do you know? Do people ever wear their hair           like this today? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What kinds of lines do you see? Find all the areas where the artist           uses repeated lines.<br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> If you could touch this work, what would it feel like? Feel your hair.           Feel the skin on your face. Would this sculpture feel the same? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Is this work <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#symmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SYMMETRICAL</a>           or <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#asymmetrical','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">ASYMMETRICAL</a>?           Explain your answer. <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How do you think this portrait sculpture was made? (a) on a potters           wheel (b) using the coil method (c) with a mold or (d) by the slab method.           Explain your answer.<br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <h3>Think<br>      </h3>      <ol>         <li> Pretend you are an archaeologist who discovered this shrine head.           What clues does the head give you about the Yoruba people? Consider           natural environment, family life, religion, aesthetics, the role of           art in life, and the importance of the kingdom of Ife. What other areas           of Yoruba culture would you explore to help you understand its meaning?         <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> What might this shrine head have been used for? Do you think it was           used in special ceremonies or in everyday life? What clues suggest its           use? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> These portrait sculptures were created to honor and commemorate the           lives of Ife's kings, queens, and other people of elite status. How           do we honor important people in our lives and our country? Why is it           important to remember and honor other people? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> Why do you think the Yoruba people maintained altars to memorialize           their ancestors? Do you have any special ways to remember your ancestors?           Why do you want to remember them? Where would you place this sculpture           if it were yours? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> The delicate vertical lines that cover the face represent a pattern           of <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#scarification','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">SCARIFICATION</a>.           The cutting of these patterns into the skin is a way of marking a person's           identity, status, and beauty. What are some ways people today show identity,           status, or beauty? Do we decorate our faces in any way? Do you think           the artist intended the sculpture as well as the subject to be appreciated           as beautiful? Why or why not? <br>		&nbsp;</li>        <li> How is this portrait sculpture different from others you have seen?           How is it the same? Have you seen other art from Africa? If so, how           is this head different from what you have seen? How is it the same?         <br>		&nbsp;</li>      </ol>      <blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>      <p><!--navmenu --> &nbsp; </p>      <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" width="225" height="20" alt="More Information">       </p>      <blockquote>         <p> <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          <a href="used.html">How was it used?</a><br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          Discussion questions.<br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>          <br>          <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a> </p>        <!--end navmenu --> </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
