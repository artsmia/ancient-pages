They         were most likely placed on altars within the palace complex and used in         religious ceremonies. The altar was probably located in a courtyard used         as a ritual area. It was surrounded by a pavement made of small, circular         potsherds laid on edge and quartz pebbles arranged in elaborate patterns.       <p><a name="return_6"></a>More recently (at the beginning of the twentieth         century), sculptured heads were repeatedly buried in the ground at the         foot of giant trees. They were dug up when needed for rituals, and afterwards         reburied. Considered too precious to be left out in the open, these heads         were reburied at the foot of a tree that marked the spot where the ceremonies         in which they were used took place.<sup><a href="#note_6">6</a></sup>       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_6"></a><a href="#return_6">6.</a> Eyo and Willett, Treasures         of Ancient Nigeria, pp. 11, 13. </p>      <p> <!--navmenu --> &nbsp;       <p><img src="../images/more_info.jpg" alt="More Information"><br>	<blockquote>		  <a href="key_ideas.html">Key ideas.</a><br>          <a href="where.html">Where does it come from?</a><br>          <a href="look.html">What does it look like?</a><br>          How was it used?<br>          <a href="made.html">How was it made?</a><br>          <a href="questions.html">Discussion questions.</a><br>          <a href="resources.html">Additional resources.</a><br>		  <br>		  <a href="../chooser.html">Select another piece.</a>		<p></p>		<!--end navmenu -->      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" align="right">  <tr>     <td><A HREF="/ceramics/index.html"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/other_ceramics.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><A HREF="http://www.artsmia.org"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/mia_home.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>    <td><a href="http://www.artsconnected.org/"><IMG SRC="/ceramics/images/common/indexed.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=30></a></td>  </tr></table><body></html>
