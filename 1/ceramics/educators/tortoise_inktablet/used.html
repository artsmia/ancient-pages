A scholar         used the inkstone to grind and mix ink for writing. The ink was made from         pine soot, compressed with an adhesive gum into a dry cake or stick. The         inkstick was crushed inside the receptacle while water was added from         a dropper. The scholar used an extremely sensitive brush to produce an         elegant form of writing called <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#calligraphy','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">CALLIGRAPHY</a>.         The flexibility of the brush depended on the type of hair used for the         bristles, with which the writer produced all variety of downstrokes and         upstrokes.       <p><a name="return_4"></a>Inkstones found in tombs tell us that many scholars         of the first and second centuries A.D. practiced calligraphy, which along         with painting was considered one of the highest arts. While painting was         used to reflect moral concerns, calligraphy revealed the style and character         of the artist. This difference parallels the dominant emerging philosophies         of the day, Daoism and Confucianism, which became the cornerstones of         Chinese thought. The two differ widely in purpose and practice; while         Confucianism stresses morality, conformity, and duty toward the state,         Daoism emphasizes individualism, nonconformity, and the relationship of         humans to nature.<a href="#note_4">4</a>       <p>During the earlier Qin dynasty, the emperor persecuted Confucian scholars         and burned their writings. Han emperors, who encouraged learning, science,         and medicine, reestablished their former place of honor in the court.         The tortoise-shaped inkstone is a rare testament to the significant position         of the scholar in Chinese society.      <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_4"></a><a href="#return_4">4.</a> For a brief summary of         Daoism and Confucianism, see Marilyn Stokstad, Art History (New York:         Harry N.
