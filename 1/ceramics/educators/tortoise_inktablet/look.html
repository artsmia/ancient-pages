He stands solidly on the ground, ready         to serve his purpose, all the while looking up and smiling with curiosity         at the writer he serves. Inkstones vary in form and design from the sumptuous         to the modest, and usually carry symbolic significance. For the Chinese,         the tortoise represented long life, strength, and endurance.       <p><a name="return_3"></a>The simple, solid form suggests that Han ceramics         were greatly influenced by tomb sculptures made from stone. Indeed, the         inkstone looks as if it were carved out of stone rather than modeled in         soft clay. Although sculpture as an art form originated with the Han,         larger sculpted works from this period have not survived. Han pottery         figures, therefore, provide clues to this new tradition. The inkstone         incorporates the major characteristics of a new style: bold outlines and         simple forms, three-dimensional works to be viewed in the round, and a         trend toward <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#realism','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">REALISM</a>.<sup><a href="#note_3">3</a>         </sup>       <p>On the shell, the artist incised a pattern of connected <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#hexagons','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">HEXAGONS</a>.         Eight of the hexagons contain three horizontal lines grouped one above         the other, called <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#trigrams','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">TRIGRAMS</a>.         Each line is either continuous or broken in the middle.

The symbols of the I Ching are appropriate for an         object used by Chinese scholars, who recorded the country's history and         philosophy in writing.
