Like the later Tang dynasty, the Han         was an era of peace, prosperity, and stability. Han leaders built on the         unification of the country begun by China's first emperor, Shi-huangdi,         from the preceding Qin (chin) dynasty (221-206 B.C.). They further expanded         the empire and established a well-organized bureaucratic system that lasted         for two thousand years. Their control of most of central Asia led to the         opening of the Silk Road, a five-thousand-mile network of caravan and         sea routes reaching all the way from China to Imperial Rome.       <p><a name="return_1"></a>Most surviving Han ceramic sculptures were made         for burial in the tombs of people at all social and economic levels. This         inkstone is a rare discovery; very few tortoise figures have been found         among tomb objects. Principal Han ceramics include jars and lamps of many         shapes, often decorated in <a href="#" onClick="WL_openGlossWindow('../glossary/index.html#low_relief','glossary','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=300,height=300')">LOW         RELIEF</a>, and mortuary figures of men, women, animals, houses, and animal         pens. Early tomb figures from the Western Han (206-about 100 B.C.) depict         military figures and life at court. Popular subjects include dancers,         acrobats, and musicians performing at banquets and festivities for the         nobility. By the time of the Eastern Han period (A.D. 25-220), all burial         pottery consisted of objects from the daily life of the common people,<sup><a href="#note_1">1</a></sup>         such as everyday pots, models of stoves, well heads, granaries, pigsties,         and houses and many other domestic items.       <p>The Han believed that humans were made up of three parts. When the body,         or xing, died, the soul separated into the po and the hun. After death,         the po stayed with the body, while the hun went to paradise. The tomb         was furnished with ming ch'i, goods to accompany the dead in the afterlife         and serve the future needs of the po. Tomb goods indicated the life and         social position of the deceased and provided familiar objects and comforts.         The inkstone identifies the tomb inhabitant as a Chinese scholar, who         would have used it as one of his tools for writing.       <p>The demand for tomb furnishings increased regard for ceramic products,         which until this time had been considered inferior to objects made of         bronze.       <hr>      <p><b>Notes</b></p>      <p><a name="note_1"></a><a href="#return_1">1.</a> S.
