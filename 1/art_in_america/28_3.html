He         combined many different shapes, sizes, textures, and colors         of wood to create an abstract landscape.         <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison</A> maintains that this art         form is an extension of painting - that he, in fact,         "paints" with wood as he also paints with acrylic and oil         paint. By attaching three-dimensional shapes to a         two-dimensional surface, he combines characteristics of both         painting and sculpture. The size of this collage attests to         <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison's</A> interest in the         large-scale works by the         <A HREF="glossary.html">ABSTRACT         EXPRESSIONIST</A> painters he knew when living in New York.         </P>                  <P>Some of the pieces of wood, as well as the inspiration         for the landscape itself, may have come from the shores of         Lake Superior. The wood exhibits various textures, from         smooth to rough, and a wide range of colors, from light gray         to deep brown. Painted red and blue pieces appear throughout         the <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>.     </P>                  <P>The horizon line is a very important element of         <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison's</A> art. He likens the         horizon of Lake Superior to the edge of the world. In this         landscape, the horizon line is about one quarter of the way         down from the top. As in other works, the first step of the         artist's working process was to determine where the horizon         line would be. He then began to lay down pieces in the lower         left corner, moving toward the horizon line. </P>                  <P>Although abstract themselves, the individual pieces of         wood suggest an endless variety of natural forms. Largely         straight-lined and angular shapes prevail above the horizon         line. Their systematic arrangement suggests the calm order         of the sky. A semicircle at the upper edge at the collage         could be the moon or the sun. The shapes below the horizon         are more irregular with curved edges. More chaotically         arranged, they suggest the variations of waves, rocks, and         water and land plants.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
