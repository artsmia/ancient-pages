What is this object? How can you tell? How many colors         did the artist use on this jar? Name them. Do these colors         look natural or artificial?</P>                  <P>2. The shapes that artists use in their designs are         called <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> and         <A HREF="glossary.html#ORGANIC">ORGANIC</A>. A geometric         shape, such as a square, triangle, or circle, has a regular         <A HREF="glossary.html#CONTOUR">CONTOUR</A>. Geometric         shapes often have straight lines and angles. Where do you         see geometric shapes in the design of this jar? An organic         shape has an irregular contour, formed by curving lines.         Where do you see organic shapes on this jar? Which of the         shapes look both organic and geometric? Are there more         organic shapes or geometric shapes?</P>                  <P>3. Is the shape of the jar itself         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> or         <A HREF="glossary.html#ORGANIC">ORGANIC</A>? Southwestern         potters sometimes use the names of parts of the human body         to refer to sections of their pottery. Which part of this         jar is the neck? The feet? The body? The mouth?</P>                  <P>4. <A HREF="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERNS</A> in a         design are created by repeating shapes, lines, and colors.         Where on this jar do you see shapes or lines repeated to         create patterns? How does the artist use color to help         create patterns? How many different patterns do you see?         Which pattern on this jar suggests motion?</P>                  <P>5. How many horizontal sections do you see on the pot?         How does the decoration on each section emphasize the part         of the pot it decorates? How do the sections and decorations         contribute to the overall balance of the pot?</P>                  <P>6. Designs can be         <A HREF="glossary.html#REPRESENTATIONAL">REPRESENTATIONAL</A>,         <A HREF="glossary.html#NONREPRESENTATIONAL">NONREPRESENTATIONAL</A>,         or a combination of both. Representational designs are those         with elements we can recognize from the world around us,         even if <A HREF="glossary.html">ABSTRACTED</A>.         Nonrepresentational designs have no obvious reference to the         world around us. Which elements in this design do you         consider representational? Which do you consider         nonrepresentational? Is the design primarily         representational or nonrepresentational?</P>                  <P><A HREF="11_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
