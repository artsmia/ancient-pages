Do you think this is a happy picture? A sad picture?         Why do you think so?</P>                  <P>2. Why might <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> have painted         with such bright colors? <B>(To show what things looked         like; to show how she felt; to convey a sense of activity;         to emphasize the brightness of being outside; because she         liked them.)</B> How would it change the way the painting         affects you if she painted the whole ground brown and green         like the area in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>?</P>                  <P>3. Why do you think <A HREF="23_3.html">Clementine         Hunter</A> chose to paint a scene of women doing the wash?         How would her painting be different if she made it today?         What activities from your life would you like to show in a         work of art?</P>                  <P>4. The <A HREF="23_5.html">African House</A> in         <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> painting was designed and         built according to one woman's recollections of her home in         Africa. What aspects of your household reflect the heritage         of members of your family? From what continents or countries         did your family come? How long ago? Have you ever visited         any of these places? What do you remember most about any of         these places?</P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="23_3.html">Clementine Hunter</A> is called a         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOLK ART">FOLK ARTIST</A>. What does         the word "folk" mean? Why might certain types of art be         called folk art? <B>(Because an artist lacks formal or         academic training; because some art forms have been passed         on through generations; because some art is characteristic         of a particular segment of a culture, which is often out of         the mainstream, etc.)</B> Some people argue that folk art is         not really art. Why might they think this? Do you think folk         art should be considered art?  What do you like best about         <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> folk painting?</P>                  <P>6. Compare <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> image of         women working on a southern plantation to other images of         women in this presentation (<A HREF="4_1.html">Mrs.         Nathaniel Allen</A>; woman in <A HREF="16_1.html">Rainy         Evening on Hennepin Avenue</A>; women in         <A HREF="17_1.html">The Steerage</A>;          <A HREF="21_html">Migrant Mother;</A> woman in         <A HREF="20_1.html">Harlem Couple</A>;         <A HREF="26_1.html">Homage to Nina Simone.</A>) What are the         different women doing? How old do you think the women are?         How does each artist convey this to you? How does their         clothing differ? What might account for these differences?         How do their different appearances, clothing, and activities         reflect the varied roles of women throughout the history of         the United States? How do the time periods in which the art         works were created affect the way the women are portrayed?         </P>                  <P>7.

What do these paintings have in common?         <B>(Bright colors, simplified forms, flat figures.)</B> How         does the use of color differ?         <B>(<A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> uses fairly         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A> color;         <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> uses         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>, arbitrary         colors.)</B> How does each artist show depth?         <B>(<A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> shows depth by placing         things that are further away from the viewer higher on the         canvas; <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> uses overlap, and         makes things which are farther away smaller.)</B> Why do you         think <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> is often called a         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOLK ART">FOLK ARTIST</A> while         <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson</A> is not? <B>(Consider:         subject matter, degree of training.)</B> Do you think each         painting shows a real or an imaginary place?
