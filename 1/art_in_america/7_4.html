The hill         rises above the village of Mendota (in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>),         which overlooks the rivers to the south. Also in the         foreground are two tepees and a group of Dakota Indians         dancing around a pole.</P>                  <P>In the middleground stand several buildings, including         two of Minnesota's earliest stone houses, which still exist         today. On the far left is a two-story building constructed         in 1839 by Jean Fairbault, founder of Mendota. To the right,         in front of a two-story warehouse, is the home of Henry         Sibley, an agent for the American Fur Company and later         territorial governor of Minnesota. To the far right is the         warehouse of the American Fur Company (no longer standing).         Also in the middleground, the Minnesota River sweeps around         Pike Island to meet the Mississippi. Identified by the U.S.         flag, the fort complex stands in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>. Visible         are several buildings organized around a parade ground         surrounded by a high stone wall.</P>                  <P>Though untrained, <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>         intuitively used several devices to create some sense of         depth in his painting. He showed objects in the foreground         larger than those further back and, using         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE">ATMOSPHERIC         PERSPECTIVE</A>, he showed the most distant parts in bluer         shades. The artist arranged the land masses and the winding         line of the river to draw the viewer's eye back to the high         <A HREF="glossary.html#HORIZON LINE">HORIZON LINE</A>.         Nonetheless, the painting still appears fairly flat because         <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> used very little         <A HREF="glossary.html#MODELING">MODELING</A> in dark and         light to indicate volume. Also, counter to the way we         actually see, he rendered every aspect of the painting with         the same amount of detail regardless of its place in the         scene.</P>                  <P>While <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>'s description of         details of the land and buildings is accurate, his         characterization of the Dakota Indians in the foreground is         inaccurate. Many European Americans believed that the         American Indians were less civilized than they themselves.         This pervasive attitude encouraged stereotypical         representation of Indians in art, including this painting.         By showing the Dakota dancing around a pole bearing enemy         scalps, <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> suggested that this         was a part of their daily life, which it was not. Further,         he showed the dance as threatening when, in fact, the Dakota         would have performed such a dance to ask forgiveness of the         other Indians they had killed. <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>         also misrepresented the tepees and the men's clothing to         make the picture more appealing. For example, he showed all         the dancers wearing long feather headdresses, which in         reality only a few highly honored men could wear. While         images like these may have helped         <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> sell more paintings, they also         contributed to damaging stereotypes.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
