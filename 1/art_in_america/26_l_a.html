What is going on in this painting? How many figures         are there? <B>(Nine.)</B> How many of them are children?         <B>(At least two, possibly four.)</B> How many red figures         do you count? Blue? Pink? Yellow? Red-violet? This painting         celebrates a singer named <A HREF="26_4.html">Nina         Simone</A>. Which figure represents the singer? How can you         tell? Name at least three ways that the artist,         <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson</A>, has drawn attention to         her. <B>(She is the only blue figure. She is in the center         of the picture. She is playing a guitar. She is placed         against a broad patch of bright orange.)</B></P>                  <P>2. What kind of day is it in this picture? How can you         tell? What might the temperature be?</P>                  <P>3. Name five things from nature in this scene. Does the         scene look natural? What about it looks natural? <B>(The         tree on the far left, the grass on the right, some of the         colors.)</B> What does not look natural? <B>(The bold colors         of the figures and some parts of the landscape; the         flatness;  the swirling lines of the sky.)</B></P>                  <P>4. An outline or         <A HREF="glossary.html#CONTOUR">CONTOUR</A> line is a line         that describes the outside edge of an object or figure.         Where do you see outlines in this picture? <B>(Around many         of the figures, around the rock/tree stump in the right         front, around the mountains and some of the clouds.)</B>         Does it look like <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> painted         the outlines or the figures themselves first? What makes you         think so? Does the outline method make the figures appear         flat or         <A HREF="glossary.html#THREE-DIMENSIONAL">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</A>?         <B>(Flat.)</B> What else about these figures makes them look         so flat? <B>(They are shown as silhouettes.) </B></P>                  <P>5. What object is farthest away from us in this painting?         <B>(The blue mountain.)</B> How can you tell? <B>(The         mountain in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A> is smaller         than everything else and it is on the         <A HREF="glossary.html#HORIZON LINE">HORIZON LINE</A>.)</B>         Which figure is closest? <B>(The seated red figure on the         right.)</B> How can you tell? <B>(By being placed so close         to the bottom of the picture, it appears to be the closest         to the viewer. It is slightly larger than the other figures.         It overlaps the yellow figure.)</B></P>                  <P>6. <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> based his         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> on a         painting by a French painter who regularly used triangles in         his pictures to give them stability. Thompson has also used         triangles. Where do you see triangles in this composition?         Which of the figure groups form triangles? Is this picture         calm or lively? How has <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A>         created a lively composition even though he has used so many         triangles?    <B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
