Look closely at this         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> painting.          What do you see?  <B>(Waterfalls, storm clouds, trees, an         American Indian, rocks, etc.)</B> </P>                  <P>2. What colors did the artist <A HREF="9_3.html">Henry         Lewis</A> use most in this painting?  <B>(Greens, browns,         blues, and whites.)</B> Where do you see pink in the         painting?  <B>(In the clouds and a touch reflected in the         water.)</B>  Where do you see red?  <B>(In the small detail         of the American Indian.)</B> </P>                  <P>3. If you could walk into this         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> painting,         where would you enter?  What makes this point the most         inviting place to enter?  Once you entered the landscape,         what sounds might you hear?  What scents might you smell?         </P>                  <P>4.         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE">ATMOSPHERIC         PERSPECTIVE</A> is a technique used by artists to show         distance.  With this technique, objects that are farther         away appear lighter and less detailed than objects that are         closer.  Where do you see atmospheric perspective in this         painting?  <B>(The trees and land behind the falls appear         smaller, lighter, and less clear than those closer .)</B>     </P>                  <P> 5. <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> sketched this scene as         he floated down the river on a pontoon.  Where do you see         moving water in this painting?  <B>(Water crashes against         rocks, giving the appearance that it is moving quickly.)</B> Where else does <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> show movement?          <B>(Storm clouds passing; some suggestion of movement in         wispy white clouds.)</B></P>                  <P>6. What do you think the weather is like, based on the         sky?  <B>(Cloudy, but clearing after a storm has just         passed.)</B>  Where is the sun?  <B>(Not visible, but pink         hue on clouds suggests it is just rising or setting.)</B>          Is it warm or cold?  How can you tell?  <B>(The cloudy sky;         the American Indian is wrapped in a blanket.)</B> <BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
