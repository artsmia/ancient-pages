What purpose was this chest used for?         <B>(Storage.)</B> Why would colonists decorate such a         functional object? Where do you store things in your home?         Are any of your containers decorated? How? Which are not         decorated? Why do you think some of these containers are         decorated and others are not? Does the difference have         anything to do with the objects stored in the containers?         With the places they are kept?</P>                  <P>2. Some of the decorations on the chest are painted black         to resemble ebony. What is ebony? <B>(A hard, dark wood from         Asia.)</B> Why would the colonists want to imitate ebony?         <B>(It was expensive and therefore highly valued; it was         considered more attractive than cheaper woods.)</B> What         other object in the <A HREF="2a_1.html">Connecticut Room</A>         was treated to look like another Asian material? <B>(The         mirror was treated to look like         <A HREF="glossary.html#LACQUER">LACQUER</A>.)</B> Do you         have anything that is made of one material but designed to         look like another?<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
