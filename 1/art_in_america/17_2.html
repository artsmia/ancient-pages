While some people         argued that photographs were only objective documents,         others argued that they could be as subjective and original         as paintings or sculptures. As late as the 1890s, few people         in America had given the issue much thought. Due in part to         the Eastman Company's development of a commercial camera         that anyone could use, photography was a popular craze among         Americans, not a respected art form.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
