Would you like to visit this place? Why or why not? If         you did visit, what could you do there?</P>                  <P>2. This painting is called a         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A>. Why do you         think it is called that? The title is Catskill Mountain         House. Do you think the Catskill Mountain House is the         subject of the painting? Why or why not? If you could give         the painting another title, what would you call it? Why?         </P>                  <P>3. Why do you think <A HREF="10_2.html">Cropsey</A> chose         to show this scene in autumn? Why not in winter? Spring?         </P>                  <P>4. What do you think of when you hear the word         "wilderness"? Does this look like a wilderness? Why or why         not? Is a wilderness safe or scary? Peaceful or exciting?         Have you been in a wilderness? What was it like? The         American Indians had lived in this land for years before         Europeans came. Do you think they thought of it as         wilderness? Why would Europeans and American Indians view         the area differently?</P>                  <P>5. Why do you think there was such a great demand for         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> paintings         like this one in 19th-century America? <B>(The paintings         were beautiful; people had never seen the areas pictured or         they had been there and wanted to remember them, etc.)</B>         Increased production of popular         <A HREF="glossary.html#PRINT">PRINTS</A> and the use of         color illustrations in magazines made landscape images         available to a wide spectrum of Americans. How might this         have contributed to a demand for paintings? What might the         paintings have offered that prints or illustrations could         not? Why didn't people just take photographs of landscapes?         <B>(Easy-to-use cameras like the Instamatics we have today         had not been invented.)</B></P>                  <P>6. How does <A HREF="10_1.html">Cropsey's painting</A>         visually express the philosophy of Manifest Destiny, popular         in 19th-century America, that proposed that European         Americans were destined by God to civilize, tame, and         dominate this land?</P>                  <P>7. Compare and contrast <A HREF="10_1.html">Jasper         Cropsey's Catskill Mountain House</A> to George Morrison's         Collage IX: Landscape. Do you think these         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPES</A> look like         actual or imaginary places? Why? What kinds of information         does each artist give us about the place represented? Which         work is         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>? Which         is <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>? What         elements do these artworks share? <B>(Some colors and a         HORIZON LINE.)</B> How do the techniques used to create         these works differ? How does each artist reveal his attitude         about the landscape? Do the materials each artist used give         any clues about his attitude? If so, how?<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~ <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
