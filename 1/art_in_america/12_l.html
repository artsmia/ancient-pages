What material is this picture painted on? How can you         tell? What parts of the elk's body can you see? What do you         see in the painting that suggests to you how the animal hide         might have been obtained?<B>  </B></P>                  <P>2. Name the animals that you see in the painting. How         many human figures do you see? How many of these are women?         How can you recognize the woman? What activity are the men         on horseback involved in? What are they using to hunt the         bison? How many bison have been killed? What are the men in         the center doing?</P>                  <P>3. Where do you see a bison being butchered? A man         placing a hide over a horse's back? A man with a long         feather headdress? A tepee? A baby bison? A pole with a         bison head on it? An eagle design? A man riding a red horse?         Men dancing with feathers in their hair?</P>                  <P>4. What colors does <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>         use? What color are the horses?  Where do you see spotted         horses? How did the artist show they are spotted? What         colors are the hunters' shirts?</P>                  <P>5. Where do you see         <A HREF="glossary.html#CONTOUR LINE">CONTOUR LINES</A>?         Where do you see straight lines?</P>                  <P>6. Is this painting active or still? How does         <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> suggest movement and         energy?  </P>                  <P>7. Look carefully at the human figures painted on the         hide. How did <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> represent         people? Did he paint them as they really looked? What parts         of the human figures did he show? What parts did he leave         out? Does each person look different or do they all look the         same? Look at the horses painted on the hide. Does each         horse look different, or do they all look the same? </P>                  <P><A HREF="12_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
