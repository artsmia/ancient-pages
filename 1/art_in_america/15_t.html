Is this a painting of a door, a photograph, or a         <A HREF="glossary.html#COLLAGE">COLLAGE</A> of objects on a         door? Why do you think so? After a discussion, tell the         students that it is a painting. Color photography was not         available before 1935. Why might the artist want to paint         something that looked so much like a real door?</P>                  <P>2. How would you describe the mood of this painting? How         does <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> create this mood? Why         might <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> have wanted to convey         this mood? Consider the title of this painting. What         happened in the United States in 1865? What happened in         America in the subsequent years? How might the death of his         father in 1895 also have influenced         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> painting?</P>                  <P>3. This painting is called         <A HREF="15_4.html">Reminiscences of 1865</A>. What does         "reminiscences" mean? Why do you think         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> would want people to remember         Abraham Lincoln? What role did Lincoln play in American         history? Do you think <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> image         of Abraham Lincoln is heroic? Why or why not? What aspect of         Lincoln has he emphasized?</P>                  <P>4. <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOLISM">SYMBOLISM</A> refers         to the use of familiar objects to refer to something else or         to suggest deeper meanings. How has         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> used symbolism in         <A HREF="15_4.html">Reminiscences of 1865</A>?</P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> painting is an homage         to Abraham Lincoln. Compare his homage to         <A HREF="26_1.html">Bob Thompson's Homage to Nina         Simone</A>. What do the paintings have in common? What are         some of the biggest differences between these two homages?         How does the overall effect of each work differ from that of         the other? What factors might account for the differences?         Consider: the subjects being honored-one, a dead U.S.         president, the other, a famous jazz singer; the dates of the         paintings-1900 and 1965. If you were going to make an homage         to someone you admire, who would you choose? What colors         would you use? What objects would you include? What setting         would you choose?</P>                  <P><A HREF="15_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
