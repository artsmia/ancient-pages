Calder grew up in an artistic         household; his mother was a painter, and his grandfather and         father were sculptors. As a child, he enjoyed inventing         mechanical toys and machines and decided to pursue a career         in engineering. After he completed his engineering degree,         however, he began to create wire sculptures of humans and         animals, which brought him great success in the art world.         Calder's contact with         <A HREF="glossary.html#AVANT-GARDE">AVANT-GARDE</A> artists         in the United States and Paris during the 1920s and 1930s         inspired him to move into purely abstract art.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
