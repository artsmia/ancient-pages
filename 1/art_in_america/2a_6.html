Most of the room's         furnishings are simple and functional but contain decorative         details of European style from the late 17th and early 18th         centuries. Incorporating even the smallest details of         familiar styles was one way for colonists to maintain ties,         however loose, to their homelands.</P>                  <P>Furniture decoration in the Connecticut Room consisted         mainly of two types: spindles turned on a lathe, for         example, the chair and table legs; and surface carving, as         on the <A HREF="2c_1.html">Connecticut storage chest</A>.         The chairs were painted to hide the fact that different         woods were used to construct them. Pillows make these         otherwise rigid forms more comfortable. The small table is         called a gateleg table because one leg swings out on each         side to support hinged leaves that make the surface larger.         On the table is a simply decorated box that once held a         family's most treasured possessions. The painted frame of         the mirror above the table imitates         <A HREF="glossary.html#LACQUER">LACQUER</A>-ware imported to         Europe from the Far East.
