Their commitment to         change social conditions through art gave birth to a new art         form called social documentary. Recognizing the camera's         power to capture immediate images, many photographers used         their <A HREF="glossary.html#MEDIUM">MEDIUM</A> to document         in graphic detail the effects of unemployment, labor unrest,         and drought. </P>                  <P> The federal government also recognized the effectiveness         of photography as a tool for social change and employed         photographers in some of its programs. Among the many new         agencies established by Franklin Roosevelt was the         Resettlement Administration, later renamed the Farm Security         Administration (FSA). Created in 1935, the program was         intended to bring financial aid to thousands of rural         workers forced to leave their farms. The FSA's Historic         Section hired 11 photographers to document the workers'         plight. These photographers produced nearly 270,000 images         that helped enlist congressional and public support for         relief projects.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
