Lacking a large urban         center like Boston, New York, or Charleston, Connecticut was         somewhat removed from contemporary fashion. While people in         the larger urban areas stayed abreast of trends in style and         fashion, the basically conservative rural communities often         lagged behind. Current styles appeared in rural homes later         than in the cities, and frequently only in small details or         local interpretations.</P>                  <P>This room is sparsely decorated. The green paint on the         <A HREF="2b_5.html">paneled wall</A>, brighter in the 18th         century, has faded with age. This wall is stylishly         decorated with <A HREF="glossary.html#RELIEF">RELIEF</A>         carving to emphasize the importance of the fireplace, which         is flanked by two         <A HREF="glossary.html#PILASTER">PILASTERS</A>. A carved         rosette, called the Connecticut rose, decorates the top of         each. Both the pilasters and the rosette are         <A HREF="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A> motifs that         were popular in European design. The other walls of the room         are stuccoed and whitewashed and the floor is sanded wood,         as they would have been during the 18th century.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
