A formal full-length portrait in the European         manner, it is a heroic image of George Washington, replete         with theatrics and         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOLISM">SYMBOLISM</A>.  The         president's dignified, austere face reveals little of his         true personality, but his rigid three-quarter pose displays         his fine clothing and accessories.  In his left hand he         holds a sword, a reference to his military achievements,         while his right hand rests on a paper scroll that probably         refers to his preference for governing by law.  Behind him,         a wind blown curtain lets in the light of dawn and reveals a         rainbow.  The rainbow is a common symbol of hope or         beginning, and the dawn may symbolize the dawn of a new era         under Washington's leadership.  The inkwell and quill refer         to lawmaking, and the many books express Washington's         authority based on the written law.  The         <A HREF="glossary.html#GILDED">GILDED</A> furniture, rich         red upholstery, and decorative red tablecloth enhance the         impression of the president's importance.  The dog         paperweight may allude to his love of the outdoors.<B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
