Thomas</A> made at least         four paintings of <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort Snelling</A> while         stationed there. Why do you think he did that? Why might         someone want a painting like this?</P>                  <P>2. Do you think <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> was more         interested in telling a story about <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort         Snelling</A> or showing exactly what he saw? Support your         response.</P>                  <P>3. The U.S. Army built <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort         Snelling</A> to ensure American control over this area. What         does this painting tell you about Euro-American attitudes         toward the wilderness in the mid-19th century? Does this         attitude still exist today? What can people do today to         prevent the destruction of the wilderness?</P>                  <P>4. Why do you think <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>         included the Dakota Indians in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> of this         painting? What details did he include to identify them as         Indians? Many European Americans at this time believed that         the Native Americans were less civilized than they         themselves were. How does <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>'s         representation contribute to this stereotype? What         stereotypes of Native Americans still exist today? In what         ways are these stereotypes damaging?</P>                  <P>5. Compare and contrast Thomas's painting View of Fort         Snelling to <A HREF="9_1.html">Henry Lewis's contemporary         painting St. Anthony Falls</A>. Where are these sites? What         do these paintings have in common? What view of nature does         each present? What does each say about the relationship of         humans to nature in the mid-19th century? Which one appears         more accurate? Why? What might account for their very         different painting styles? When was each painting made?         <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort Snelling</A> was constructed between         1820 and 1824 using logs from a mill built by U.S. soldiers         at <A HREF="9_2.html">St. Anthony Falls</A>. Considering         this information along with the dates of each painting,         which one seems more accurate? Also discuss the ways both         artists misrepresent the American Indians. How do their         representations differ?</P>                  <P><A HREF="7_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
