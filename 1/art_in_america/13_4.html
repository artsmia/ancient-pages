They         carved enough ladles so that everyone at a feast would have         his or her own. Other ladles were used for transferring food         from large cooking containers to individual bowls.</P>                  <P>This feast ladle from the late 19th century is shaped         like a bird. In this         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>         representation, the handle forms the bird's head and neck,         and the spoon is the body. The only surface markings are the         dots that represent the eyes and the line that shows the         opening of the beak.</P>                  <P>Among the <A HREF="13_2.html">Seneca</A>, wooden objects         carved in the shape of birds or animals usually served a         religious function such as offering thanks at a feast. The         carver would conceive of the image in a dream or vision.         Many Woodlands peoples believed that birds had spiritual         powers because they flew to heights that humans could not         reach. They revered and honored birds by incorporating bird         images into the objects they created.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
