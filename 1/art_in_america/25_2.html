After         years of scarcity during the war, the American public was         eager to buy new products. Many people came into extra cash         as the war bonds in which they had invested matured. One         popular item of purchase was a car. With increased         production and purchasing of automobiles, America became a         car culture. As car owners became more mobile, suburbs grew         up around many U.S. cities, and material possessions to fill         new homes became a common measure of success. Billboard         advertisements reached the newly mobilized audience, and the         introduction of television brought commercial advertising         into many American homes.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
