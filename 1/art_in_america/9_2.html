He         first saw the dramatic falls in the company of the Dakota         Indians, whose name for the sacred water was Minirara,         meaning "curling water."  </P>                  <P>The Mississippi River was crucial to the exploration and         settlement of Minnesota in general, and the St. Anthony         Falls were especially important to the development of         Minneapolis and St. Paul.  The natural power captured from         the waterfalls allowed the development of the mills that         made Minneapolis the nation's foremost producer of flour.          Sawmills, foundries, factories, and a host of other         enterprises also grew up in the area. </P>                  <P>Tragically, the development of Minnesota also meant the         destruction of the Dakota peoples' way of life.  For         centuries, the Dakota had considered the lands surrounding         the falls as their homeland.  As white settlers and the U.S.         government took over this land beginning in the early 19th         century, the Dakota inevitably suffered great losses.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
