Where was <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> standing when         he sketched or painted this scene? What makes you think so?         Explain that artists often made sketches but then completed         their paintings indoors.</P>                  <P>2. The title of this painting is         <B><A HREF="7_4.html">View of Fort Snelling</A></B>. Where         is Fort Snelling in this picture? Is the fort the most         important part of the painting? Why or why not? Did you         notice the fort first when you looked at the painting? If         not, what did you notice first? What drew you to that part?         </P>                  <P>3. The artist organized the painting into three distinct         sections-a         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>,         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>, and         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>.

What devices does <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> use to         create a sense of depth in this         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> painting?         </P>                  <P>5. What time of year do you think it is? How can you         tell? Does it look as if it is warm or cold out? What clues         suggest this to you?</P>                  <P>6. This painting records a site in Minnesota territory at         which European Americans and Native Americans came into         contact and conflict. Where do you see Native Americans?         What are they doing? Do you see European Americans in the         picture? What aspects of the picture indicate their         presence?<B>) </B></P>                  <P>7. The term         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>         describes art in which the subject is depicted as closely as         possible to the way it is seen by the human eye.

Overall, would you describe the painting as         naturalistic?
