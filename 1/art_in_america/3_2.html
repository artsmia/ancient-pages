A native of Scotland, Stuart served         as the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the British         government <SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>. The Stuart family         had to leave South Carolina when the American Revolution         broke out in 1775. This house still stands today at 106         Tradd Street in Charleston.</P>                  <P>Like many 18th-century houses in this bustling seaport,         the Stuart house was one room wide and flanked by a         two-story porch on one side. Because Charleston is mild in         winter and hot in summer, the ceilings were high and the         windows large to allow cool breezes to circulate. The first         floor of the three-story house contained a reception room         and dining room (also on view at The Minneapolis Institute         of Arts). The drawing room and a bedchamber made up the         second floor. The third floor had additional bedchambers.         The kitchen was located in a separate structure.<B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE><BR>                           <HR>         <A NAME="1"></A>1. Originally called Charles Towne in 1670,         the settlement was incorporated as Charles City and Port in         1722.  The city was reincorporated under the name Charleston         in 1783.</P>                  <P><A NAME="2"></A>2. The Cherokee and Creek Indians, who         lived in South Carolina, had a history of giving their         support to the British in wartime.  It was therefore vital         and in the interests of the British government to have         Colonel Stuart in the colonies maintaining good will and the         allegiance of the Indians during this pre-revolutionary         period.<BR>                  <BR>                  <A HREF="3_2.html">Top of Page</A>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
