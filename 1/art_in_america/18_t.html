Based on this painting, how do you think         <A HREF="18_2.html">O'Keeffe</A> felt about New York City?         Why?</P>                  <P>2. Name three adjectives to describe the mood of this         night scene. Then, imagine that         <A HREF="18_2.html">O'Keeffe</A> had painted in every window         on these <A HREF="18_4.html">skyscrapers</A>. How would this         addition change the mood conveyed?  What changes would you         have to make to turn this into a daytime scene? How would         these changes alter the mood of the painting?</P>                  <P>3. Central to <A HREF="18_2.html">O'Keeffe's</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A> is her interest in         the <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A> forms that         she sees in the world around her, like the shapes of flower         petals or the long lines of         <A HREF="18_4.html">skyscrapers</A>. Choose an object from         your classroom. Study it carefully. What abstract forms do         you see within your chosen object? If you were going to         paint this object, what aspects or details would you have to         leave out to emphasize the abstract qualities?</P>                  <P>4. Why do you think <A HREF="18_2.html">O'Keeffe</A>         chose this point of view? What elements of city life was she         able to include by choosing this point of view? What         elements was she able to exclude?</P>                  <P>5. Compare O'Keeffe's City Night to         <A HREF="19_1.html">Grant Wood's painting of Herbert         Hoover's birthplace</A>. These paintings were made only a         few years apart. What elements of the American experience         during this era does each represent? How does each use         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACTION</A>? What         overall mood does each create? If         <A HREF="18_2.html">O'Keeffe</A> had painted the rural scene         and <A HREF="19_1.html">Wood</A> had painted the         <A HREF="glossary.html#CITYSCAPE">CITYSCAPE</A>, how do you         think each would look?<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
