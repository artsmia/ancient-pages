The         artist represented the place as the tourist attraction it         had become rather than as it looked at         <A HREF="19_2.html">Hoover's</A> birth in 1874. The small         cottage where the president was born attracted many visitors         who paid ten cents to tour it.</P>                  <P><A HREF="19_4.html">Wood</A> depicts the historic site         from a high vantage point on the crest of a hill. In the         green valley below, a tour guide points to the cottage,         located near a larger white house. A sign in front         identifies it as <A HREF="19_2.html">Hoover's</A>         birthplace. Sunshine illuminates the large family homes,         neatly mown lawns, and perfectly clipped trees in the quiet         neighborhood surrounding the cottage. Many details - hanging         laundry, toylike chickens, two boys in overalls, and a         distant field of haystacks-round out this gentle rural         scene.</P>                  <P>Through his extensive European training,         <A HREF="19_4.html">Wood</A> had developed a technique based         on a linear treatment of form and precise brushwork. Despite         this exacting technique, he consciously made his forms         appear simple. He simplified the boxlike houses to make         geometric shapes and treated the trees as solid, rounded         clumps of leaves. Through repetition, these enormous leaves         form decorative patterns. Likewise, the many tiny straight         brushstrokes that define the trim lawns create a rhythmic         pattern. <A HREF="19_4.html">Wood</A> describes all of the         forms, whether close or distant, with the same degree of         detail and bathed in the same clear light, even though one         would not see them this way in nature. While everything in         the scene is recognizable, the overall effect of         <A HREF="19_4.html">Wood's</A> painting resembles a         storybook world more than reality.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
