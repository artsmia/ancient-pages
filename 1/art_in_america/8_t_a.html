Why might an artist make a bust instead of a         full-body sculpture? Why might someone want a smaller         sculpture? This bust is about lifesize. Where would you         place this sculpture if it were yours?</P>                  <P>2. How old do you think George Washington is in this         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>? Why did         <A HREF="8_3.html">Hiram Powers</A> represent the president         as an aging man? <B>(To make the bust similar to a type of         ancient Roman portrait sculpture that showed men in their         advanced years; to emphasize his many years of service to         the nation; because age was valued in men.)</B> What         qualities do you think <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> is         trying to emphasize? <B>(Experience, wisdom, power,         respect.)</B></P>                  <P>3.

It refers to a revival of the art and         ideas of ancient Greece and Rome.)</B> What aspects of this         sculpture evoke ancient Greece and/or Rome? <B>(The toga is         an ancient form of clothing; the bust format and         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISM">NATURALISM</A> evoke         ancient Roman sculpture; marble was extensively used in         classical sculpture.)</B> What is new about it? <B>(The         subject, George Washington, is contemporary.)</B> Did George         Washington really wear a toga? What did he wear? Why did         <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> show George Washington wearing         a toga? <B>(To evoke ancient Roman sculpture; to allude to         the values of the ancient Roman republic; because this was a         popular device for         <A HREF="glossary.html">NEOCLASSICAL</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAITS</A> of the         time.)</B></P>                  <P>4.

How is a chunk of marble made into a sculpture? <B>(It         is chiseled and carved.)</B> Before carving this         <A HREF="glossary.html#BUST">BUST</A> in marble,         <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> made a clay model. How is         making a sculpture out of marble different from making one         out of clay? <B>(When working in clay, you mold the material         with your hands to build something out of it.
