This room set up in the museum is called a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PERIOD ROOM">PERIOD ROOM</A>.  Why         might this room and other rooms in museums be called period         rooms?  Why are these rooms in a museum?  What makes a         period room different from a room in someone's house?            </P>                  <P>2. In this image of the Charleston Drawing Room, you can         see electric lights.  Would these lights have been used in         1772? Why or why not? How would the room have been lit?</P>                  <P>3. Why might the family have chosen to decorate with so         much red throughout the room? How would the room look if         many different colors were used throughout? </P>                  <P>4. Though made in the colonies, some of the furniture in         this room emulates Chippendale furniture, which was very         fashionable in England at the time.  Why would the Stuart         family want to have furniture that was fashionable in         England? Why would they have the furniture made in the         colonies rather than import it?</P>                  <P>5. The furnishing and decoration of this room from         Charleston, South Carolina, reflect the British heritage of         the family that lived here.  Which, if any, of the         furnishings,  decorations, or items in your home reflect         your family's heritage?             </P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast this drawing room from Charleston         to the Connecticut Room. Which looks larger?  Why do you         think this is so?  Which would have had more light?  Which         one comes from a home in a warmer climate?  How can you         tell?  Which one looks more comfortable?  Why do you think         so?  Which one would you prefer to spend time in?  Why?</P>                  <P><A HREF="3_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
