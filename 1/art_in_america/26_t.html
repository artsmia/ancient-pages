How do you feel when you look at this painting? What         about the painting makes you feel this way? Do the bright         colors affect the way you feel? How would your feelings         change if the colors were darker? What if they were pastel         colors? </P>                  <P>2. Why do you think <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson</A>         chose to show the figures in this painting nude?</P>                  <P>3. Jazz is a very improvisational music. What is         improvisation? In what ways does         <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson's</A> painting also appear to         be improvisational?</P>                  <P>4. This is an homage to the singer         <A HREF="26_4.html">Nina Simone</A>. What is an homage? How         is this painting an homage? Based on this painting, how do         you think <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> felt about         <A HREF="26_4.html">Simone</A> and her music? What kind of         music would you guess <A HREF="26_4.html">Nina Simone</A>         performs? What musician would you like to honor in a         painting? What kind of music does she or he perform? What         colors do you think would be most appropriate to represent         the way you feel when you listen to this person's music?         </P>                  <P>5. For centuries, artists have looked closely at the work         of other artists as inspirations for their own art. They         often borrow poses of figures, entire         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITIONS</A>, and         other ideas from the art that inspires them. Under what         circumstances do you think it is okay to borrow something         from a work of art to make your own work of art better? Are         there any circumstances under which it is not okay to borrow         something from another work of art? Why isn't         <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson's</A> painting considered a         copy of Poussin's painting?</P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast Bob Thompson's <B>Homage to Nina         Simone</B> with <A HREF="16_1.html">Robert Koehler's Rainy         Evening on Hennepin Avenue</A>. Do these works of art have         anything in common? If so, what? Compare         <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson's</A> treatment of the human         figure to <A HREF="16_1.html">Koehler's</A> treatment. What         kind of mood is expressed in each painting? How does each         artist create the mood? What do you like best about the         <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A>? What do you like best         about the <A HREF="16_1.html">Koehler</A>?</P>                  <P><A HREF="26_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
