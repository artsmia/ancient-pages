Why might <A HREF="21_4.html">Dorothea Lange</A> have         chosen this point of view for her photograph? How would the         effect of this picture be different if         <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange</A> had photographed the family         from a distance? From above? If she had focused only on the         woman's face and didn't include the children?</P>                  <P>2. Why do you think <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange</A> posed         the figures to create a triangle? <B>(This pose enhances the         sense of a stable family, despite their economic         situation.)</B> Why do you think she composed the photo to         be so balanced? <B>(This         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> holds         the picture together and makes it more powerful; it focuses         attention on the mother, etc.)</B> How would the composition         hold together if the mother's arm was resting across the         bottom of the photo? If the two older children were on the         same side?  </P>                  <P>3. Why do you suppose this photograph became an         <A HREF="glossary.html#ICON">ICON</A> of         <A HREF="21_2.html">the Great Depression</A>?</P>                  <P>4. How is a photograph different from a painting? Does a         photographer have as much freedom in creating a photograph         as a painter does creating a painting? Why or why not? Use         <A HREF="21_4.html">Dorothea Lange's</A>         <B><A HREF="21_5.html">Migrant Mother</A></B> as an example         to support your response. </P>                  <P>5. What does "documentary" mean? How can a photograph be         a social document? What can a photograph show that other         documents cannot? Why would the United States government pay         photographers to take pictures like this? For what could         such pictures be used? Where could they be shown? Where do         you see documentary photographs today? In what media can you         see documentary photos that people in         <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange's</A> era could not?         <B>(Television.)</B></P>                  <P>6. Some documentary photographs, like this one, are made         with the subject's permission. Others are not. Would you         allow a documentary photographer to take your picture? Why         or why not? Are there some circumstances under which you         would allow your picture to be taken and others under which         you would not allow it? If so, why?</P>                  <P>7. Compare and contrast this photograph with         <A HREF="20_1.html">James van DerZee's contemporaneous photo         Harlem Couple</A>. Consider: point of view of photographer,         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>,         subject. <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange's</A> photograph is         considered documentary, and <A HREF="20_1.html">van         DerZee's</A> is considered a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>. Is one photo         more objective than the other? In what ways is         <A HREF="20_1.html">van DerZee's</A> photo documentary? In         what ways is <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange's</A> photograph like         a portrait?<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
