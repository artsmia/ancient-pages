Abigail's blue eyes dominate         her small, solemn face.  Light gray ruffles and a bow         decorate her deep-gray dress.  Her hairpiece is adorned with         bright blue flowers.</P>                  <P>The flatness and incorrect proportions of Badger's         portrait recall the provincial style of English portraiture. Abigail Gowen poses stiffly before a neutral gray backdrop, which         gives little indication of a THREE-DIMENSIONAL space.          Badger used only minimal MODELING in dark and light to         convey any roundness of form.  Although Abigail's head is         slightly large for her slender body, the blushing cheeks,         round chin, and tiny mouth suggest that Badger captured a         good likeness of her. </P>                  <P>During the 18th century, it was customary for a sitter to         pose for the artist only during the painting of the face.          The other details of clothing and background could be added         later.  Therefore, an artist might use the same clothes,         poses, and other details in several portraits. </P>                  <P>Early artists had to make their own paint by grinding         pigment and mixing it with linseed oil.  The type of paint         used by portraitists was often the same paint that house         painters used.  Typically, the colors faded in time.  Since         blue was more stable than other colors, it has remained the         brightest.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
