What kinds of details did the artist choose to leave         out of this bird-shaped bowl? <B>(Wings, feet, feathers,         etc.)</B> Why do you think the artist chose to leave these         details out? How would the bowl be different if these         details were added?</P>                  <P>2. Where does clay come from? Why do you think the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> and other Mississippian potters         used clay to make their containers? <B>(Clay was readily         available; clay containers are durable and can serve many         purposes.)</B> Have you ever made anything from clay? How         did you do it? How was this bowl made? <B>(Explain coil         method.)</B> Why might the coil method be particularly         suited for making pottery?</P>                  <P>3. The <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> depended largely on         agriculture for their livelihood. Why would the development         of agriculture lead to pottery production? <B>(It leads to         permanent settlements, so people would not have to be         concerned with transporting heavy, breakable pottery; it         makes storage and serving vessels necessary.)</B> For what         purpose do you think this vessel was used? <B>(For storing         or serving foods; perhaps for religious purposes.)</B> Why         would someone make special vessels for food? <B>(A special         container indicates the importance of food.)</B></P>                  <P>4. The art of Native Americans of the Mississippi valley         tells us that they made useful objects special by decorating         them. How has this bowl been decorated? <B>(The additions of         head, eyes, and tail make it look like a bird.)</B> Look         around your classroom. Name several objects that are useful.         Are they decorated? Why are some useful objects not         decorated? <B>(Not everyone cares if all objects are         beautiful, as long as they can do their job; some objects         are made as plain as possible so as to not distract their         users.)</B> Think of objects you have at home that are         useful. Are any of these decorated? How? If you could make         any object in your classroom beautiful, which object would         you choose? Why? How would you decorate it or change it to         make it beautiful?</P>                  <P>5. We do not know for certain why the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> potter chose to make this bowl         in a bird form. We assume that the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> respected birds and may have         considered them spiritual creatures. Why might the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> have admired birds so much?         What special qualities do birds have that humans do not?         </P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast this <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A>         vessel with the <A HREF="11_1.html">Acoma Pueblo Jar</A>.         What do they have in common? <B>(Both are made of clay; both         are containers, etc.)</B> Can you tell that both objects         were made using the coil method? If yes, how? If no, why         not? How do they differ? What might account for these         differences?<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
