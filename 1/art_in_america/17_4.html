Below the         first-class upper deck, he saw passengers crowded into the         less costly steerage level below. The steerage was divided         into an upper and lower deck joined by a narrow stairway.         </P>                  <P><A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> recalled:</P>                  <P>The scene fascinated me: A round straw hat; the funnel         leaning left, the stairway leaning right; the white         drawbridge, its railings made of chain; white suspenders         crossed on the back of a man below; circular iron machinery;         a mast that cut into the sky, completing a triangle. I stood         spellbound for a while. I saw shapes related to one another         - a picture of shapes, and underlying it, a new vision that         held me: simple people; the feeling of ship, ocean, sky; a         sense of release that I was away from the mob called "rich."         (Quoted in Dorothy Norman, <B>Alfred Stieglitz: An American         Seer</B> (Middleton, N.Y.: Aperture, 1973) p. 76.)</P>                  <P><A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> ran to get his camera,         hoping that the man with the white hat, the man in         suspenders, and a seated woman with a child below would not         move. He felt that the perfection of the         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> would be         lost if those key elements changed. Luckily, they remained         in position and he took his photograph.</P>                  <P><A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> made this print of The         Steerage for his avant-garde publication <B>Camera Work</B>,         in 1911, using a specialized ink-printing process called         <A HREF="glossary.html#PHOTOGRAVURE">PHOTOGRAVURE</A>. The         repeated circles, triangles, and rectangles that captivated         him structure the photograph. The sunlit bridge provides a         bold diagonal that visually connects the distinctively         different upper and lower decks. The upper group consists         primarily of darkly dressed men, while the lower crowd is         made up mostly of women and children wearing lighter colors.         The inactivity of the standing group above contrasts with         the active lines of the flowing garments, the makeshift         clothes line, and the movement of figures below.</P>                  <P>The Steerage is the photograph         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> said he would want to         represent him if he could choose only one. He felt that this         spontaneous photograph perfectly captured related shapes as         well as human feelings.<B> </B><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
