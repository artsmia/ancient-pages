Typical of most two-story         farmhouses of this type, the house had two rooms on each         floor arranged around a central chimney. This first-floor         room was the parlor. The parlor was the main room of the         house, where the family received guests and observed special         family events. The four-post bed in the corner shows that         the room was also the main bedroom. The kitchen, on the         other side of the paneled wall, had a large fireplace like         the one in the parlor. The two rooms on the second floor         were the children's bedrooms and storage space.</P>                  <P>The paneled wall surrounding the fireplace-the focal         point of the room-is original to the house. Museum staff         recreated the other parts of the room to resemble the         original when they installed it in the museum in 1928.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
