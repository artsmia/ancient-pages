Based         on this painting and the name of the movement, what do you         think regionalists painted? <B>(Distinctive characteristics         of a region of the United States.)</B> What region is         represented in this painting? <B>(The title indicates that         this is West Branch, Iowa, in the midwestern United         States.)</B> What physical aspects of rural Iowa did Wood         emphasize? <B>(Flat rural landscape, corn fields, wooden         farm buildings, deciduous trees, changing seasons.)</B> What         values does he emphasize? <B>(Family, home, neighbors, farm         work, the idea that anyone can become a U.S. president.)</B>         How would this painting look different if         <A HREF="19_2.html">Herbert Hoover</A> had been born in the         southwest United States? In California? In Alaska?</P>                  <P>2. <A HREF="19_4.html">Grant Wood's         </A><A HREF="glossary.html#LINEAR">LINEAR</A> treatment and         simplification of forms, use of         <A HREF="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</A>, and extensive         use of detail give the scene in this painting the appearance         of a storybook world. Why might <A HREF="19_4.html">Grant         Wood</A> have wanted to make his paintings of rural America         look more like storybook worlds than the real world? How         would your feelings about this painting change if he had         represented the scene         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISM">NATURALISTICALLY</A>?         </P>                  <P>3. <A HREF="19_4.html">Grant Wood</A> and his         contemporaries in American art during the 1930s and 1940s         liked to raise ordinary experiences of everyday life to         legendary proportions. How did <A HREF="19_4.html">Wood</A>         do this in the <A HREF="19_5.html">painting of Herbert         Hoover's birthplace</A>? Why do you think American artists         at this time wanted to elevate common experiences? Why would         people living during the hard times of the Depression and         two world wars want to see art that affirmed American         values?</P>                  <P>4. <A HREF="19_4.html">Grant Wood's</A> painting shows         how extraordinary things can happen to ordinary people. Has         anything extraordinary ever happened to you or someone else         you know? What? How would you represent this event in a         painting without actually showing yourself or the other         person?</P>                  <P>5. How does <A HREF="19_4.html">Grant Wood's</A> painting         play upon the familiar American ideal that anyone can grow         up to become president of the United States? Does this ideal         hold true today? How do gender, race, and economic status         affect one's ability to become president of the United         States?  </P>                  <P>6.

Why or         why not? Does one look more naturalistic than the other? Can         you tell which artist is untrained and which one had         extensive training as a painter?
