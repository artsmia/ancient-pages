Where was <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> standing when         he sketched or painted this scene? <B>(On a hill looking         down.)</B> What makes you think so? Explain that artists         often made sketches but then completed their paintings         indoors.</P>                  <P>2. The title of this painting is         <B><A HREF="7_4.html">View of Fort Snelling</A></B>. Where         is Fort Snelling in this picture? <B>(In the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>.)</B> Is         the fort the most important part of the painting? Why or why         not? Did you notice the fort first when you looked at the         painting? If not, what did you notice first? What drew you         to that part?</P>                  <P>3. The artist organized the painting into three distinct         sections-a         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>,         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>, and         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>. What did         he include in the foreground? <B>(Tepees, trees and foliage,         American Indians who are dancing, sitting, and walking         around, a few brick buildings at the bottom of the         hill.)</B> What do you see in the middleground? <B>(Water,         the confluence of two rivers, two canoes, an island with         more tepees.)</B> What is in the background? <B>(Fort         Snelling, other buildings, sky with a few clouds.)</B></P>                  <P>4. What devices does <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> use to         create a sense of depth in this         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> painting?         <B>(Organization of         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> into         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>,         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>, and         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>; showing         objects in the foreground larger than those further back;         use of         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE">ATMOSPHERIC         PERSPECTIVE</A>.)</B></P>                  <P>5. What time of year do you think it is? <B>(Fall or late         summer perhaps.)</B> How can you tell? <B>(Many of the trees         have brown leaves, and the grass is a mixture of green and         brown.)</B> Does it look as if it is warm or cold out? What         clues suggest this to you? <B>(The Native Americans who are         not dancing are wrapped in blankets; the smoke rising from         the tepees may suggest the temperature was cool.)</B></P>                  <P>6. This painting records a site in Minnesota territory at         which European Americans and Native Americans came into         contact and conflict. Where do you see Native Americans?         <B>(<A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> and         probably in the canoes.)</B> What are they doing?         <B>(Dancing around a pole with scalps hanging from it,         sitting, walking, canoeing.)</B> Do you see European         Americans in the picture? <B>(No.)</B> What aspects of the         picture indicate their presence? <B>(The fort, the other         architecture, the U.S. flag.) </B></P>                  <P>7. The term         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>         describes art in which the subject is depicted as closely as         possible to the way it is seen by the human eye. What looks         naturalistic about <A HREF="7_4.html">Thomas's View of Fort         Snelling</A>? What aspects of the painting do not look         naturalistic? Overall, would you describe the painting as         naturalistic? Why or why not? <B>(Although the subject and         objects are recognizable, the scene does not look as it         really would because of Thomas's handling of space and         details, and the lack of         <A HREF="glossary.html#MODELING">MODELING</A>.)<FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
