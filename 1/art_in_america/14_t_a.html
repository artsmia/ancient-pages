Tell the story of turtle's association with creation         in <A HREF="14_2.html">Lakota</A> culture. Women beaded         turtle <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</A> on their         dresses, leggings, bags, and on cradleboards and         <A HREF="glossary.html#AMULET">AMULETS</A> for their baby         girls. Why do you think turtle is associated with women in         <A HREF="14_2.html">Lakota</A> culture?         <B>(<A HREF="14_3.html">Turtle's</A> association with         creation makes it an animal representative of women's power         to create life.)</B></P>                  <P>2. The characteristics of a         <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A> were prized by         <A HREF="14_2.html">Lakota</A> people. Wome aspired to be         like the <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A> and hoped their         children would also take on the qualities of the         <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A>. What qualities do         <A HREF="14_3.html">turtles</A> have that women might want         for themselves and their children?         <B>(<A HREF="14_3.html">Turtles</A> live very long lives,         are resilient, can thrive on both land and water, and are         always protected by their shell.)</B></P>                  <P>3. <A HREF="14_2.html">Lakota</A> mythology surrounding         the <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A> has to do with the         creation of the world. Can you think of another popular         story about a <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A>? <B>("The Hare         and the Tortoise.")</B> What qualities were associated with         that <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A>? <B>("Slow and steady         always win the race.")</B> Can you think of other animals         that exhibit qualities people find desirable? <B>(Lions are         courageous; foxes are sly and smart; elephants have great         memory; owls are wise; mice are quiet; bees are busy; oxen         are strong.)</B></P>                  <P>4. This <A HREF="14_2.html">Lakota</A>         <A HREF="14_5.html">dress</A> was made to be worn while         dancing. If we were to see it as it was meant to be used, we         would hear music, the beads would reflect the light, the         bells would jingle, and the fringe would swing and sway with         the dancer's movements. Is it possible for us to appreciate         this dress as a work of art even though we cannot see it         being worn in a dance? Why or why not? Would we appreciate         the dress more if we could see the dress on a dancer? Why or         why not? <B>(No right answer.)</B></P>                  <P>5. Do you have a garment that you wear for special         occasions? Of what materials is it made? How is it         decorated? What kinds of activity are you involved in when         you wear it? <B>(Baseball uniform, ballet costume, party         clothes, Cub or Girl Scout uniform, etc.)</B> What features         of the garment identify you as part of a special group,         family, or nationality?</P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast the Lakota Woman's Dress and         <A HREF="12_1.html">Cadzi Cody's Painted Hide</A>. What         material do these two have in common? <B>(Hide.)</B> What         was each used for? <B>(The dress was made to be worn for         dancing; the hide was made to record aspects of Plains         Indian life.)</B> What are the basic differences between the         designs? <B>(The designs on the dress are         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> and very         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>; the designs         on the hide are         <A HREF="glossary.html#REPRESENTATIONAL">REPRESENTATIONAL</A>         and slightly         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>.)</B> What do         you think the designs on each object show or mean? <B>(The         <A HREF="14_5.html">dress</A> refers to the         <A HREF="14_3.html">turtle</A> and the creation story; the         hide shows important events in Plains Indian life.)</B><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
