What kind of tools would an artist need to carve wood?         Is wood hard or soft? Why do you think this artist used         wood? Do you have a ladle at home? What do you use it for?         Is the ladle you have made of wood or some other material?         Is your ladle made by hand? Where did you get it?</P>                  <P>2. Why do you think the artist carved the ladle in the         form of a bird? List some words that you think describe a         bird in flight. What words describe a bird sitting on the         ground? Are they the same? Which words that you have used         best describe the bird that makes this ladle? If you were         going to make a tool in the form of an animal, which animal         would you choose? Why?</P>                  <P>3. Why did the artist use so many curved lines on this         ladle?</P>                  <P>4. Why do you think the Woodlands people carved their         ladles so elaborately? Can you think of a time that you have         tried to make something look very special? Why was it         important to you to make this special?</P>                  <P>5. Many Native Americans respect the earth and offer         thanksgiving for its many gifts to them. What gifts of the         earth would the Woodlands people have been thankful for at         the time this ladle was made? Are there any gifts of the         earth for which you are thankful? What are they? How do you         show your appreciation for the earth?</P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast the Seneca Feast Ladle and the         <A HREF="1_1.html">Caddo Effigy Bowl</A> . What material is         each made of? What was each used for? What do they have in         common? Can you tell what kinds of birds these are? If so,         how can you tell? If not, why not? What aspects of the bird         did each artist emphasize?</P>                  <P><A HREF="13_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
