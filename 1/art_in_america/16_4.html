The leafless trees and the         warmly dressed figures suggest that it is late fall or early         spring. With loose brushstrokes and a limited palette of         browns, grays, and blues, Koehler creates the aura of a         rainfall that has just stopped. He depicts glistening         puddles, the cloud-filled sky, furled umbrellas, and a soft,         misty atmosphere. Various sources of light add a touch of         warmth to the cool damp evening. Light glows from the         library and church windows, shines from the streetcars,         illuminates the face of a man who stops to light his pipe,         breaks through clouds, and reflects off the rain-soaked         street and sidewalk.</P>                  <P>In the <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>,         the artist's wife, Marie, and their son, Edwin, walk with         the family dog. Fashionably dressed, Mrs. Koehler lifts her         long skirt, to prevent her hem from sweeping the wet ground.         Typical of the early 20th century, her dress emphasizes her         silhouette, enhanced by the waist-pinching corset commonly         worn underneath. Her hairstyle is the pompadour, drawn up         high with a large hat perched on top. Her son wears a         jacket, knee pants, and a cap. Other elements of the         scene-electric streetcars, a horse-drawn carriage, and a         bicyclist-provide a glimpse of transportation just before         the age of the automobile.</P>                  <P>Looking south from Ninth Street, the scene includes the         buildings located around Tenth Street and Hennepin Avenue.         The prominent building on the left with the lighted         first-floor window is the Minneapolis Public Library, which         housed the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts, of which Koehler         was director. On the right is the Hennepin Avenue Methodist         Episcopal Church, which stood on that site from 1881 to         1911. It was known as the Red Brick Church, and its steeple         was a prominent landmark in downtown Minneapolis. At that         time the southern end of Hennepin Avenue was more         residential than the commercial end to the north.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
