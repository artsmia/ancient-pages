What purpose was this chest used for? Why would         colonists decorate such a functional object?  Where do you         store things in your home?  Are any of your containers         decorated?  How?  Which are not decorated?  Why do you think         some of these containers are decorated and others are not?          Does the difference have anything to do with the objects         stored in the containers?  With the places they are kept?         </P>                  <P>2. Some of the decorations on the chest are painted black         to resemble ebony.  What is ebony? Why would the colonists         want to imitate ebony? What other object in the         <A HREF="2a_1.html">Connecticut Room</A> was treated to look         like another Asian material? Do you have anything that is         made of one material but designed to look like another?</P>                  <P><A HREF="2c_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
