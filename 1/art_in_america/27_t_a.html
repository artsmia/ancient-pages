Do you think this is a flattering picture of         <B><A HREF="27_3.html">Frank</A></B>? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>2. What did <A HREF="27_2.html">Close</A> accomplish in         this painting that he could not have accomplished in a         photograph? <B>(It is 9 feet by 7 feet! It is far larger         than a photograph.)</B></P>                  <P>3. Why might <A HREF="27_2.html">Chuck Close</A> paint         his friend's <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>         from a photograph rather than from life? <B>(He felt a         photograph could capture some truth about         <A HREF="27_3.html">Frank</A> that lengthy portrait sittings         could not; he wanted to concentrate on the act of painting,         etc.) </B></P>                  <P>4. What makes this painting a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>? <B>(It shows         the likeness of a friend of the artist.)</B> What makes it         more a painting of a photograph than a picture of an         individual? <B>(It shows the parts of the photograph that         were out of focus-the artist didn't correct them for the         sake of the portrait; the large size forces the viewer to         see all the painted marks rather than the face when viewing         the painting up close.)</B></P>                  <P>5. Although <A HREF="27_2.html">Chuck Close</A> has said         that he is interested in his subject's personalities, it is         often hard to see this in the paintings. Why might he want         to leave out information about the individuals he paints?         How does the enormous size of this painting contribute to         the depersonalizing quality? How does his mechanical         technique contribute to this quality?</P>                  <P>6. A writer once referred to portraits like this one as         "giant face-scapes." What do you think he meant? Do you         think this is a good way to describe         <B><A HREF="27_3.html">Frank</A></B>? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>7. Many of the early paintings in this image set are very         small. Where could you hang a small painting? <B>(Small         interiors, private homes.)</B> The photographs in the set         are relatively small. Where could you display a photograph?         <B><A HREF="27_3.html">Frank</A></B> is huge. Where could         you display it? <B>(It could fit only in a very large space         such as a studio, museum, gallery, corporate lobby, or very         large home.)</B> What does this say about developments in         American art during the 1960s and 1970s?</P>                  <P>8. Compare and contrast Close's painting Frank to         <A HREF="21_1.html">Dorothea Lange's photograph <B>Migrant         Mother</A></B>. Consider:         <A HREF="glossary.html#SCALE">SCALE</A>, degree of focus,         subject, etc. Then, compare and contrast Close's painting to         <A HREF="4_1.html">Copley's painting <B>Mrs. Nathaniel         Allen</A></B>. Do you think Close's         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> of         <B><A HREF="27_3.html">Frank</A></B> is more like         <A HREF="21_1.html">Lange's</A> portrait or like         <A HREF="4_1.html">Copley's</A>?
