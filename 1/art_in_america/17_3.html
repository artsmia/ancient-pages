He was a visionary photographer himself as         well as a passionate advocate of photography as a fine art.         Stieglitz organized exhibitions of modern American         photography and published several journals of photographs         and essays. In 1905 he opened his own gallery, later known         as 291, in New York. There he exhibited avant-garde         photographers as well as works by Europe's leading modern         painters and sculptors. C&eacute;zanne, Matisse, Picasso,         and others had their first major U.S. exhibits there.         Stieglitz also showed work by many young American         modernists, including Arthur Dove and         <A HREF="18_1.html">Georgia O'Keeffe</A>.</P>                  <P>Always eager to expand his knowledge of the camera and         printing processes, Stieglitz experimented with many kinds         of photography. During the early 1900s, he was particularly         interested in making         <A HREF="glossary.html#STRAIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY">STRAIGHT         PHOTOGRAPHS</A> - those exposed and printed without special         techniques that would change their appearance. He wanted to         compose each photograph entirely before actually taking the         picture. He searched his surroundings for inherently         interesting images, especially in terms of shape         relationships, black-and-white contrasts, and emotional         impact.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
