If you could enter this scene, what sounds would you         hear? What might you smell?</P>                  <P>2. What can you deduce about downtown Minneapolis in 1902         by studying this painting?</P>                  <P>3. The artist, <A HREF="16_2.html">Robert Koehler</A>,         was influenced by a French         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A> called         <A HREF="glossary.html#IMPRESSIONISM">IMPRESSIONISM</A>.         What is an impression? What about this painting is         impressionistic? <B>(The artist is more interested in         showing the overall appearance of the scene than individual         objects and people; he leaves out details of faces,         clothing, and buildings, which we wouldn't see on a foggy         evening; he shows a fleeting moment.)</B> How does         <A HREF="16_2.html">Koehler's</A> use of loose, visible         <A HREF="glossary.html#BRUSHSTROKE">BRUSHSTROKES</A> enhance         the sense of an impression in this painting?</P>                  <P>4. Why did <A HREF="16_2.html">Koehler</A> make the         people and objects in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> larger         than those in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BRUSHSTROKE">BACKGROUND</A>? <B>(To         create the illusion of depth.)</B> Why did he make the         buildings in the background bluer than those in the         foreground? <B>(Also to create the illusion of depth.)</B>         </P>                  <P>5. Why do you think <A HREF="16_2.html">Koehler</A>         included his wife, son, and dog in this picture? If you         created a picture of your hometown, would you include any         members of your family? Why or why not? Would you include         your friends? <A HREF="16_2.html">Koehler</A> also includes         his workplace, the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts, then         housed in the public library. What buildings or institutions         would you include in your picture in order to tell viewers         something about yourself?</P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast <A HREF="16_1.html">Robert         Koehler's Rainy Evening on Hennepin Avenue</A>, Georgia         O'Keeffe's City Night, and James van DerZee's Harlem Couple.         What aspects of urban development does each artwork address?         How do you think each artist feels about city life? What         makes you think so? In which picture(s) is the city the most         important element? In which are the people most important?         What makes you think so? Why do you think each artist chose         to represent the city at the time of day he/she did?<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
