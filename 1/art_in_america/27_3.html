Based on a professional black-and-white photograph         composed by <A HREF="27_2.html">Close</A>, it is more a         portrait of that photograph than of his friend Frank.         <A HREF="27_2.html">Close</A> believed that a split-second         photograph could reveal some truth about a person that could         be lost in the lengthy sittings of a traditional portrait         painter. He did not emphasize his subject's personalities,         however. <A HREF="27_2.html">Close</A> hoped that by         choosing relatively anonymous subjects, he could encourage         viewers to concentrate on his works more as paintings than         as portraits. He also emphasized the works as paintings by         using enormous billboard-sized canvases.</P>                  <P><A HREF="27_2.html">Close</A> presented a         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMMETRY">SYMMETRICAL</A>, closeup         view of Frank's head and shoulders against a uniform         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>. Early in         his career, he decided to use this same format for all of         his portraits so he would not have to concern himself with         decisions about         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>. In this         way he could concentrate instead on the painting itself.         </P>                  <P>The unflattering view of Frank and the blandness of his         expression are characteristic of all of         <A HREF="27_2.html">Close's</A> early images. He described         every contour and shadow of the photograph of Frank, giving         the same attention to every detail-tousled hair, bushy         eyebrows, facial pores, tightly closed lips. He wanted to         explore the relationship of the various parts of Frank's         face. One writer described portraits like Frank as "giant         face-scapes,"<SUP><A HREF="#footer">1</A></SUP>  since up         close they appear as a large continuous surface of small         dots, marks, shapes, tints, and tones rather than an image         or personality. Looked at in this way, the image of the city         reflected in Frank's glasses is no more important than the         button on his shirt collar. </P>                  <P>This portrait is also about perception - about how we         see. The tip of Frank's nose and the edges of his hair,         ears, beard, and collar are slightly out of focus, as they         appeared in the photograph. Only that area between the nose         and ears, which includes his glasses and the hairs on his         chin, is in sharp focus.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE><BR>                  <A NAME="footer"></A>1 Martin Friedman in Lisa Lyons and         Martin Friedman, Close Portraits (Minneapolis: Walker Art         Center, 1980), 13.      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
