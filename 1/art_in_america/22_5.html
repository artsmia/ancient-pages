The article         condemned the cost of racial discrimination, especially         during wartime, and advocated integration as both a social         and financial necessity in the American workplace.</P>                  <P>Factory Workers exemplifies         <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden's</A> early social-realist         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A>. Dominating the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> are the         monumental figures of two men standing beside a red brick         structure. Immediately behind them is a shadowy third figure         and, further back, a smoky factory complex. To the right are         three cartoonlike rocks and an abstract form resembling the         rear of a car. One man points, while the other looks at         something outside of the picture. Only the distant factory         and a smudge of orange dirt on the smaller man's striped         pants identify them as factory workers. Rather than         depicting these men as dehumanized or machinelike,         <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden</A> showed them as individuals         with distinct personalities and styles.</P>                  <P>Reminiscent of his political cartoon style,         <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden</A> used strong contour lines         and exaggerated features to express the individual         characters and moods of these men. He omitted descriptive         details that would interrupt the flow of his lines and the         solidity of his forms. Instead he subtly modulated color and         value to create richly varied surfaces, as in the mens'         jackets and faces. Like the rocks and car, the factory is         abstract. Of all the images in the painting, only it is         reduced to basic         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> shapes. In         contrast to the <A HREF="glossary.html#ORGANIC">ORGANIC</A>         forms and subdued blues, grays, and browns of the men, the         geometric regularity and the bright red, white, and black of         the factory emphasize its dehumanizing nature.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
