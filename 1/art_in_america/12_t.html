Why did <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> paint the         horses in different colors? Why might he have painted some         of the horses pink and blue even though horses are not these         colors? Why do you think he did not paint any of the horses         black?  </P>                  <P>2. Why do you think <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>         painted all of the people alike, but represented horses in         so many different ways?</P>                  <P>3. Why are so many bison painted on this hide? How did         Plains people use the bison?</P>                  <P>4. Do you think <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> was         more interested in showing how things looked or in telling a         story? What makes you think so? </P>                  <P>5. Why might <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> have used         elk rather than bison hide for his painting at this time?          </P>                  <P>6. The nomadic way of life of the Plains people was         different from the lives of other Native Americans who         stayed in one place. How do you think the Plains lifestyle         affected the type of art that they made?</P>                  <P>7. When <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> painted this         hide, the Shoshone Indians were confined to a reservation         and their traditional way of life had all but vanished.Why         do you think he continued to paint traditional aspects of         Indian life?</P>                  <P>8. Compare <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>'s Painted         Hide with <A HREF="24_2.html">Alexander Calder</A>'s         <A HREF="glossary.html#MOBILE">MOBILE</A>         <A HREF="24_1.html">Ahab</A>.
