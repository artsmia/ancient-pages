Out of work, the family was living         in a makeshift tent and eating frozen vegetables from the         surrounding fields and wild birds caught by the children.         <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange</A> took a series of photographs         of the family, each moving in closer to her subject. The         last of the series was the closeup known as <B>Migrant         Mother</B>. Reproduced in countless newspapers, books,         magazines, and films, and shown in exhibitions worldwide,         this compelling photo is an icon of <A HREF="21_2.html">the         Depression</A>.</P>                  <P>The mother cradles a baby in her lap, while two young         children cling to her sides, their faces turned from the         camera. The woman, though facing         <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange's</A> camera, averts her eyes to         gaze beyond it. Her gaunt, lined face, supported by her         strong right arm and hand, reveals both her hardship and her         inner strength.</P>                  <P>The power of this photograph derives largely from         <A HREF="21_4.html">Lange's</A> point of view and         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>. By         moving in close for the shot and eliminating the setting,         she focused on the human element of her subject. She posed         the figures to create a triangle that enhances the sense of         a stable family, despite their economic situation. The         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> is         tightly balanced to draw attention to the mother. The         shoulder of the child on the left, the mother's hand, and         the bent arm of the child on the right create an         <A HREF="glossary.html#IMPLIED LINE">IMPLIED LINE</A> that         visually divides the photo in half. The arrangement of forms         implies a second line running from top to bottom, which         crosses the first line in the center.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
