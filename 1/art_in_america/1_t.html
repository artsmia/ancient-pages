What kinds of details did the artist choose to leave         out of this bird-shaped bowl? Why do you think the artist         chose to leave these details out? How would the bowl be         different if these details were added?</P>                  <P>2. Where does clay come from? Why do you think the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> and other Mississippian potters         used clay to make their containers? Have you ever made         anything from clay? How did you do it? How was this bowl         made? Why might the coil method be particularly suited for         making pottery?</P>                  <P>3. The <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> depended largely on         agriculture for their livelihood. Why would the development         of agriculture lead to pottery production? For what purpose         do you think this vessel was used? Why would someone make         special vessels for food?</P>                  <P>4. The art of Native Americans of the Mississippi valley         tells us that they made useful objects special by decorating         them. How has this bowl been decorated? Look around your         classroom. Name several objects that are useful. Are they         decorated? Why are some useful objects not decorated? Think         of objects you have at home that are useful. Are any of         these decorated? How? If you could make any object in your         classroom beautiful, which object would you choose? Why? How         would you decorate it or change it to make it beautiful?         </P>                  <P>5. We do not know for certain why the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> potter chose to make this bowl         in a bird form. We assume that the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> respected birds and may have         considered them spiritual creatures. Why might the         <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A> have admired birds so much?         What special qualities do birds have that humans do not?         </P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast this <A HREF="1_2.html">Caddo</A>         vessel with the <A HREF="11_1.html">Acoma Pueblo Jar</A>.         What do they have in common? Can you tell that both objects         were made using the coil method? If yes, how? If no, why         not? How do they differ? What might account for these         differences?</P>                  <P><A HREF="1_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
