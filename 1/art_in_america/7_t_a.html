Thomas</A> made at least         four paintings of <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort Snelling</A> while         stationed there. Why do you think he did that? <B>(He wanted         to record how it looked; people wanted to buy his         paintings.)</B> Why might someone want a painting like this?         <B>(To recall the experience of being stationed at the fort;         because they had never been in the area and wanted to know         what it looked like; because it is a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PICTURESQUE">PICTURESQUE</A>         place.)</B></P>                  <P>2. Do you think <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> was more         interested in telling a story about <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort         Snelling</A> or showing exactly what he saw? Support your         response.</P>                  <P>3. The U.S. Army built <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort         Snelling</A> to ensure American control over this area. What         does this painting tell you about Euro-American attitudes         toward the wilderness in the mid-19th century? <B>(Land was         something to be taken over, settled, and controlled.)</B>         Does this attitude still exist today? What can people do         today to prevent the destruction of the wilderness?</P>                  <P>4. Why do you think <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>         included the Dakota Indians in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> of this         painting? What details did he include to identify them as         Indians? <B>(Tepees, feather headdresses, pole with enemy         scalps.)</B> Many European Americans at this time believed         that the Native Americans were less civilized than they         themselves were. How does <A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>'s         representation contribute to this stereotype? What         stereotypes of Native Americans still exist today? In what         ways are these stereotypes damaging?</P>                  <P>5. Compare and contrast Thomas's painting View of Fort         Snelling to <A HREF="9_1.html">Henry Lewis's contemporary         painting St. Anthony Falls</A>. Where are these sites?         <B>(Both are in Minnesota.)</B> What do these paintings have         in common? <B>(They are both         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPES</A>; both have         a lot of detail.)</B> What view of nature does each present?         What does each say about the relationship of humans to         nature in the mid-19th century? Which one appears more         accurate? Why? <B>(Lewis's painting seems more accurate         because of his         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>         painting style.)</B> What might account for their very         different painting styles? <B>(<A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A>         had no training as an artist; <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A>         had extensive training in Europe.)</B> When was each         painting made? <B>(<A HREF="7_3.html">Thomas</A> painted         <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort Snelling</A> around 1850, and         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> painted <A HREF="9_2.html">St.         Anthony Falls</A> in 1855.)</B> <A HREF="7_2.html">Fort         Snelling</A> was constructed between 1820 and 1824 using         logs from a mill built by U.S. soldiers at         <A HREF="9_2.html">St. Anthony Falls</A>. Considering this         information along with the dates of each painting, which one         seems more accurate? <B>(Lewis's painting cannot be accurate         since he chose to leave out the mill.</B>) Also discuss the         ways both artists misrepresent the American Indians. How do         their representations differ?<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
