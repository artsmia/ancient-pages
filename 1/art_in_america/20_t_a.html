What do you think these people wanted to convey about         themselves in this         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>? What aspects         of the photo led you to your answer?</P>                  <P>2. Why might <A HREF="20_2.html">James van DerZee</A>         have chosen to pose this couple and their car in front of         these buildings? <B>(Because the buildings are visually         interesting; they characterize the urban environment;         perhaps the couple lived there, etc.)</B> How does the         repetition of forms in the buildings contribute to the         visual interest of this photograph? Why might         <A HREF="20_2.html">van DerZee</A> want to contrast the new         car with the old buildings?</P>                  <P>3. What do you consider the most important aspect of this         photograph? Why?</P>                  <P>4. Have you ever had your         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> taken by a         professional photographer? Who made decisions about what you         would wear? Where the photo would be taken? How you would         pose? What props would be included?         <A HREF="20_2.html">James van DerZee</A> thought that his         subjects should decide these things for themselves. If you         could make such decisions, what would you want your         photograph to look like?</P>                  <P>5. Discuss the <A HREF="20_3.html">Harlem         Renaissance</A>. What evidence in this photograph tells you         that Harlem was a thriving community at this time?</P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast James van DerZee's photograph         Harlem Couple with <A HREF="22_1.html">Romare Bearden's         GOUACHE Factory Workers</A>. What do they have in common?         <B>(Both show people; both show aspects of urban life.)</B>         What things does each artist use to tell us about the         people? <B>(Buildings, surroundings, dress, poses.)</B>         <A HREF="20_2.html">Van DerZee's</A> photograph is a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>. Would you         consider <A HREF="22_1.html">Bearden's gouache</A> a         portrait also?
