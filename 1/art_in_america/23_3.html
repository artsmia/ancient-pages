There she worked in the cotton         fields and later in the main house as a cook. She married         and raised her family at Melrose and remained there for the         rest of her life. Because Melrose's owner encouraged visual         artists, writers, and musicians to visit and work on the         plantation, Hunter was exposed to a wide variety of art. She         began to paint during the 1940s, when she was nearly 60,         using paints and brushes left behind by a visiting artist.          Before long, outsiders came to the plantation to buy her         paintings.</P>                  <P>Hunter is called a folk painter because she had no formal         training and worked outside of the mainstream art world. She         painted the daily activities of the black Americans living         on Melrose and neighboring plantations in a direct and         colorful manner. In addition to weddings, funerals, and         Saturday-night brawls, she painted many scenes of workers         picking cotton, threshing pecans, and boiling wash in the         plantation yard. Hunter's paintings provide a rich sense of         her feelings about plantation life.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
