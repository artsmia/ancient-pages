After an unsettled childhood, Hoover became a very         successful mining engineer, amassing a fortune while         operating mines in the United States, England, Australia,         and China. During and after the First World War, he ran         several relief committees to aid Americans as well as         oppressed Europeans. Hoover's dedication to relief efforts         made him a hero.</P>                  <P>Knowing Americans' love for rags-to-riches stories,         Hoover kicked off his presidential campaign with a public         rally in his rural hometown. The campaign was successful,         and in 1929 Hoover became president of the United States.         Tragically, later in 1929 the stock market crashed, bringing         about the Great Depression. Unemployment and bankruptcy         devastated Americans across the country.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
