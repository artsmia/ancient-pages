As was common in 19th-century         American landscapes, the drama-filled sky covers nearly half         of the canvas. Dark gray storm clouds pass through on the         right, leaving in their wake blue sky and fluffy white         clouds highlighted with touches of pink cast by the low sun.         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> emphasized the falls themselves         by stretching them horizontally across the painting's         midsection. The water cascades over the natural platform and         rushes down the river, creating white froth as it hits the         rocks and other objects in its path.          <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> conveyed this action through         many loose         <A HREF="glossary.html#BRUSHSTROKE">BRUSHSTROKES</A>, which         also capture the broken reflections of the rosy,         cloud-filled sky and the darker storm clouds. Using         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE">ATMOSPHERIC         PERSPECTIVE</A>, he created a believable sense of depth.           </P>                  <P>Despite the fact that we can sense the great power of the         water as it rushes over the falls, the painting conveys a         tranquil and peaceful scene. A solitary American Indian sits         on a rocky ledge overlooking the falls. He is smoking a         pipe, a traditional means of prayer for many Indian people.         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> drew attention to the Indian by         clothing him in a bright red garment that stands out against         the natural green colors of the landscape.  Because many         Americans had heard about but not seen Native Americans, a         demand for paintings of Indians developed.  Although         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> knew individual Native         Americans, this painting presents a highly romanticized view         of Native Americans in general and their relationship to         nature. Also, it gives no indication of the atrocities         American Indians suffered as settlers and the government         took over their lands. </P>                  <P>Every aspect of the painting suggests an idyllic world         unspoiled by civilization. Yet, by the time         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> made his original sketch and         certainly by 1855, considerable building had taken place         around the falls. For instance, a sawmill was located there         as early as 1822 to supply the construction needs of         <A HREF="7_1.html">Fort Snelling</A>.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
