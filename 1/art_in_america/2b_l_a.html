What items do you see in this room? Does the room look         crowded? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>2. Where do you see wood in this room? (Floors, door,         trim, chairs, bed, walls, in the fireplace.) Where do you         see bricks? (Fireplace.) Where do you see metal? (Andirons.)         Where do you see fabric? (Bed covers/curtains.) Where do you         see paint? (Walls.)</P>                  <P>3. The green wall panel is carved in RELIEF. This means         that some parts of the wall are raised above others. Which         parts of this wall are raised? How can you tell?</P>                  <P>4. What kinds of lines dominate this room? (Many straight         lines.) Where do you see straight lines in this room?         (Floorboards, PILASTERS, paneling on doors and main wall,         baseboards, trim, fireplace, chairs.) Look very closely.         Where do you see curving lines? (The chairs, andirons,         rosettes above the PILASTERS.) Does the emphasis of the room         seem to be more horizontal or vertical? Why?</P>                  <P>5. What is TEXTURE? (The way something feels.) What         texture would the floors be? What texture would the bed         covers be? What item in the room looks the most rough?         (Brick fireplace.) Stucco is a plaster or cement finish for         walls. Which parts of the room are stucco? What do you think         these walls feel like? What clues do you get from the image?         </P>                  <P>6. The electric lights in the ceiling of this room would         not have been there originally since electricity had not yet         been invented in the 18th century. Where would the light in         this room have come from? (Sunlight through windows,         candles, fireplace.) Where would you go in this room if you         wanted to read during the day? Where would you go if you         wanted to read in the evening?<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
