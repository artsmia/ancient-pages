Why do you suppose the furniture was moved against the         wall when the room was not in use?  <B>(To allow easier         movement through the room.)</B>  How would the room look if         the furniture was away from the walls and arranged         throughout the room?  How would you arrange the furniture?           </P>                  <P>2. <A HREF="glossary.html#PERIOD ROOM">PERIOD ROOMS</A>         are installations of actual rooms or portions of rooms that         have been removed from historic houses.  They tell us a lot         about the people who lived in them.  What can you deduce         about the people who lived in this room from a farmhouse in         Foxon, Connecticut?  If you could have any room from your         home placed in a museum, which room would you choose?  Why?          What could people learn about you and your family by         studying the room you have chosen?</P>                  <P>3. Look at the chair you sit in at school.  Compare and         contrast it to one of the chairs in the Connecticut Room.          What material is each chair made of?  Do you think your         classroom chair is more or less comfortable than the         Connecticut chair?  Why?  What color is each?  How was color         applied to each?  Which chair do you consider more         attractive?  Why?    </P>                  <P>4. The people who lived in the Connecticut Room were a         bit behind the times in fashion trends.  Why?  <B>(They did         not have a big city nearby like Boston or New York.)</B>  Do         you keep up with new trends and styles?  How?  Why did it         take a lot longer for people living in the 18th century to         find out about new styles?  Do you ever hold onto things         even if they are out of style?  Why?  Why might the people         in rural colonial America have held on to their possessions         even if they were out of style?  <B>(It was not practical to         buy new things if the ones you already had were still         usable; the old styles may have reminded them of the homes         they left behind; perhaps they liked the things whether or         not they were in fashion.)</B><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
