The 28 works of art assembled         here will guide your class through an exploration of the         definitions of American art and the things we can learn         about the American experience by studying its art. We hope         your students will appreciate and value the diversity of         American people and experiences through the study of art.         You may also choose to explore these questions in the         context of other study areas, including language arts,         humanities, social and cultural studies.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  Primary resources included are the images and corresponding         essays. Each essay contains the following:<p></P>                  <UL>            <LI>Key points                        <LI>Historical and cultural information                        <LI>Description of the work of art                        <LI>Discussion of the style of the work of art                        <LI>LOOK questions that focus on what can be gleaned form            direct observation                        <LI>THINK questions that expand upon what students see            and draw conclusion         </UL>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  Supplementary resources include:<p></P>                  <UL>            <LI>An illustrated timeline                        <LI>A chart suggesting relationships between works of art                        <LI>Recommended activities                        <LI>Glossary (all glossary terms appear in CAPITAL            LETTERS in the text)         </UL>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  Please keep in mind that these materials are written for         you-the educator. They are not intended to be read to or by         your students. You will need to adapt the information to         your curriculum objectives and your students learning         styles. For example, visual learners may look at images         before any information is presented, while kinesthetic         learners may benefit from activities included in these         materials before they view the images.

If you would like to reserve a docent-led tour, please         call the Tour Office at (612) 870-3140 at least one month in         advance.</P>                  <P>When you schedule a docent-led tour, your docent will         contact you before your tour date. Since it is not possible         for the museum to keep all works of art on view at all         times, we recommend that you plan to discuss your particular         interests with your docent when he or she calls. Because         April and May are the museum's busiest months, we encourage         you to schedule tours at other times of the year for a less         crowded visit.</P>                  <P>Now, if you're ready, begin exploring Art in America with         the <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER>To the Teacher ~                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~                   <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
