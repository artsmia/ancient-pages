Fascinated by American advertising, she began         <B>Billboard</B> by selecting colorful images from Life         magazine, which she then arranged on her wall. As she         painted these images, she continued to invent, improvise,         and expand upon her initial idea, not knowing what the final         product would be. Moving clockwise from the upper left         corner, <A HREF="25_5.html">Hartigan</A> painted: a smiling         face and toothpaste tube from an Ipana commercial; the neck         of a wine bottle, a glass and a drinker; a Dole pineapple;         peaches and whipped cream; an apple with a bite out of it;         piano keys; lime jello with fruit; figure from a Campbell         soup ad; and oranges.</P>                  <P>With a wide variety of strong brushstrokes, vivid colors,         and clever juxtapositions of forms,         <A HREF="25_5.html">Hartigan</A> infused these still images         with the energy of a bustling city environment. By placing         <A HREF="glossary.html">COMPLEMENTARY         COLORS</A>-reds and greens, blues and oranges-next to one         another, she heightened their intensity. Many of the         brushstrokes reveal <A HREF="25_5.html">Hartigan's</A>         gestures, an important element of action painting. She         freely spread images, color, and brushstrokes across the         painting's entire surface so that no one element dominated         the others. This all-over composition is characteristic of         abstract expressionism.</P>                  <P><A HREF="25_5.html">Hartigan's</A> use of the advertising         imagery of mass culture in <B>Billboard</B> coincides with         the earliest stages of the American <A HREF="25_3.html">pop         art</A> movement. Whereas many of the pop artists         intentionally adopted a detached attitude of noninvolvement         in their subjects, <A HREF="25_5.html">Hartigan</A>         intentionally involves the viewer in her creative         experience, especially with her expressive brushwork.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
