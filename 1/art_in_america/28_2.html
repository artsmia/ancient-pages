He         was educated at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design         and the Art Student's League in New York City. Morrison also         studied in France under a Fullbright scholarship. In 1970 he         accepted a joint appointment to the American Indian Studies         and Studio Arts departments at the University of Minnesota,         where he remained until his retirement in 1983. His art is         included in museums and private collections throughout the         United States and abroad. Although he is widely known for         his wood collages and constructions, Morrison considers         himself primarily an abstract painter.</P>                  <P>Lake Superior and its North Shore environment have         significantly inspired Morrison's art. He said of his         process," In this search for my own reality, I seek the         power of the rock, the magic of the water, the religion of         the tree, the color of the wind, and the enigma of the         horizon."<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
