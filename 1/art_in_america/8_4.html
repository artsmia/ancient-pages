Houdon had studied the president         firsthand, so his sculpture was considered one of the most         accurate likenesses. <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers's</A>         portrait is at once idealized and naturalistic. Washington's         strong nose, jowls, and wrinkles, as well as his stern         expression, appear natural. In the Roman tradition of         honoring the accomplishments of aging men in portrait busts,         <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> stressed the president's         maturity. The toga gracefully draped over Washington's         shoulders conjures up images of venerable Greek nobles or         Roman senators and raises the sculpture into the realm of         idealism. The portrait becomes a         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</A> of the "New         Republic."</P>                  <P>Through skillful chiseling and carving of a piece of         marble, <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> created the illusion         of various <A HREF="glossary.html#TEXTURE">TEXTURES</A>. The         heavy folds of the toga contrast with the smoothness of         Washington's flesh. His hair, pulled back off his high         forehead and gathered at the nape of his neck, appears soft.         <A HREF="8_3.html">Powers</A> probably chose to work in         marble because so many of the most venerated art works from         ancient Greece and Rome were carved from this material. Not         knowing that most of the ancient sculptures were colorfully         painted in their original state, 19th-century artists and         patrons alike placed high value on the whiteness of marble.         They equated the whiteness with the nobility, rationalism,         and high purpose of their ancient predecessors.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
