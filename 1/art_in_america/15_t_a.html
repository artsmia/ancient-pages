Is this a painting of a door, a photograph, or a         <A HREF="glossary.html#COLLAGE">COLLAGE</A> of objects on a         door? Why do you think so? After a discussion, tell the         students that it is a painting. Color photography was not         available before 1935. Why might the artist want to paint         something that looked so much like a real door? <B>(To trick         his viewers into believing that they were seeing a real         door; to show off his skill as a painter.)</B></P>                  <P>2. How would you describe the mood of this painting? How         does <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> create this mood? <B>(The         colors are dull; things are worn, torn, and rusty; Lincoln's         expression is grim; the repetition of rectangles makes the         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>         rigid.)</B> Why might <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> have         wanted to convey this mood? Consider the title of this         painting. What happened in the United States in 1865?         <B>(The Civil War ended, and Lincoln was assassinated.)</B>         What happened in America in the subsequent years? How might         the death of his father in 1895 also have influenced         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> painting?</P>                  <P>3. This painting is called         <A HREF="15_4.html">Reminiscences of 1865</A>. What does         "reminiscences" mean? <B>(A recalling of past         experiences.)</B> Why do you think         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> would want people to remember         Abraham Lincoln? What role did Lincoln play in American         history? Do you think <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> image         of Abraham Lincoln is heroic? Why or why not? What aspect of         Lincoln has he emphasized?</P>                  <P>4. <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOLISM">SYMBOLISM</A> refers         to the use of familiar objects to refer to something else or         to suggest deeper meanings. How has         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> used symbolism in         <A HREF="15_4.html">Reminiscences of 1865</A>? <B>(The         aging, beat-up condition of the door and objects on it         refers to the passing of time as well as to the sad and         hopeless attitude that many Americans had at the end of the         19th century, and to <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> own         state of mind; the photo, nickname, and dates all refer to         Lincoln, but also to the deeper meaning of the impact of his         death on the nation and on <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A>; the         coin and worthless bill refer to the nation's obsession with         money; the man on the bill was an abolitionist, and his         image may indirectly refer to Lincoln's Emancipation         Proclamation of 1862.)</B></P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> painting is an homage         to Abraham Lincoln. Compare his homage to         <A HREF="26_1.html">Bob Thompson's Homage to Nina         Simone</A>. What do the paintings have in common? <B>(Very         little.)</B> What are some of the biggest differences         between these two homages? How does the overall effect of         each work differ from that of the other? What factors might         account for the differences? Consider: the subjects being         honored-one, a dead U.S. president, the other, a famous jazz         singer; the dates of the paintings-1900 and 1965. If you         were going to make an homage to someone you admire, who         would you choose? What colors would you use? What objects         would you include? What setting would you choose?<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~<A HREF="categories_comparison.html">                  Categories for Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
