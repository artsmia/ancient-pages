Although their styles         varied, they all painted large, expansive views of nature in         the Hudson River valley. The Hudson River School artists         were largely responsible for the development of landscape as         a subject in American art during the 19th century. Increased         production of popular         <A HREF="glossary.html#PRINT">PRINTS</A> and the use of         color illustrations in magazines made their landscape images         available to many Americans.</P>                  <P>The Catskill Mountain range in New York was an especially         popular subject for the Hudson River School painters, both         because of its natural beauty and because it was relatively         easy to reach from eastern cities. Few easterners had         ventured west to the frontier, which by then extended to the         Mississippi River. Consequently, the mysterious forests of         the Catskills awed and fascinated many.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
