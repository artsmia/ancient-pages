What makes you think so? </P>                  <P>2. Why do you think <A HREF="4_3.html">Mrs. Allen</A> and         her husband wanted to have         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAITS</A> made? <B>(To         serve as visual records, to send to family, to hang in the         home, to show their status.)</B>  Why do people today have         portraits made?  <B>(For the same reasons.)</B>  Why do many         more people have portraits made nowadays than during         colonial times? <B>(Photography has made it possible for         more people to afford portraits.) </B></P>                  <P>3. Do you consider this a good         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>?  Why or why         not?  Do you consider this a beautiful portrait?  Is a good         work of art necessarily beautiful?  Is a beautiful work of         art necessarily good? </P>                  <P>4. Copley based the scenery, pose, and clothing on an         <A HREF="glossary.html#ENGRAVING">ENGRAVING</A> of a         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> of an English         noblewoman made several years earlier.  What information are         we left with about the real <A HREF="4_3.html">Mrs.         Allen</A>?  <B>(What her face looked like and her desire to         be represented in this type of portrait.)</B>  Where could         you go if you wanted to have a costume portrait made?          <B>(Victorian photography at The Mall of America; Frontier         photography at the State Fair's Heritage Square; Glamour         Shots, etc.)</B>  Why do we have costume photos made?          <B>(Amusement; to make us look like something or someone we         want to be like.)</B></P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="4_2.html">Copley</A> had two problems to deal         with in the colonies.  One was the absence of art schools.          The other was that the only paintings         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMMISSION">COMMISSIONED</A> were         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAITS</A>.  How do you         think an artist could learn to paint without art schools?          <B>(Look at other paintings, apprentice oneself to an         artist, look at books, experiment on ones own.) </B> Why do         you think people only wanted portraits?  <B>(They perceived         portraits as the only useful kinds of paintings; they did         not have money to spend on art they did not consider         useful.)</B>     </P>                  <P>6. Compare and contrast <A HREF="4_2.html">Copley</A>'s         <A HREF="4_4.html">Portrait of Mrs. Nathaniel Allen</A> to         <A HREF="27_1.html">Chuck Close's painting <B>Frank</B>         </A>.  What size is each painting?  What is the relationship         between artist and subject in each?  For what purpose was         each made?  How did each artist determine his         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>?  Which         one is more         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>?  Why         do you think so?  When was each painting made?  How does         this factor account for the differences discussed?<B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
