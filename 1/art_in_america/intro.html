Throughout the lands         that now constitute the United States, native peoples         established vital art traditions centuries before Europeans         arrived. Over the last three centuries, people have come to         America from many nations, bringing their own artistic         heritages with them. As these diverse cultures came into         contact with one another and exchanged creative ideas, new         art styles developed.<p></P>                  <P>What then is American art? While this question has no         single answer, it is possible to explore many of the threads         that contribute to the rich tapestry of American art. By         studying art made in America, we can also learn a great deal         about the experiences that make up our shared history. The         artworks in this presentation, dating from the 12th to the         20th century, tell us about America's history-its lands,         people, and daily experiences.</P>                  <P>The vast and varied landscape of America has meant many         things to the people who live here. A         <A HREF="1_1.html">clay effigy bowl by a Caddo Indian</A>         exemplifies the earliest Americans' respect for the land as         a valuable resource. The expansive         <A HREF="10_1.html">Catskill Mountain landscape by Jasper         Cropsey</A> or the site of <A HREF="7_1.html">Fort Snelling         as recorded by Edward K. Thomas</A> convey an experience of         the wilderness as well as of the development that         transformed the American landscape.         <A HREF="28_1.html">George Morrison's large abstract         collage</A>, created from pieces of wood of varying sizes,         textures, and colors, represents a more recent response to         the American land.</P>                  <P>America's population is as varied as its landscape, and         artists play an important role in recording that diversity.         Their visual records introduce us to U.S. farm and factory         workers, musicians, and a vast array of others who have         contributed to America's history. <A HREF="4_1.html">Mrs.         Allen's formal portrait, painted by John Singleton         Copley</A> in the 18th century, typifies portraits         commissioned by wealthy colonial Americans who prized         realistic likenesses but who also desired to associate         themselves with English aristocracy through traditional         poses and studio props. The introduction of photography         revolutionized the representation of America's people, as         shown in <A HREF="17_1.html">Alfred Stieglitz's photo of         immigrants</A> returning to their homelands in 1907, or in         <A HREF="20_1.html">James Van DerZee's portrait of a         couple</A> during Harlem's cultural renaissance.</P>                  <P>Works of art that portray the activities of people         provide insight into American ways of life.         <A HREF="12_1.html">Cadzi Cody's painted elk hide</A> shows         parts of a Shoshone bison hunt and sun dance, and         <A HREF="23_1.html">Clementine Hunter's colorful         painting</A> shows southern plantation workers doing the         wash. The modest furnishings of an         <A HREF="2b_1.html">18th-century parlor from a farmhouse in         Foxon, Connecticut</A>, reveal that the same room functioned         both as the main parlor, where guests were received, and as         the master bedroom. <A HREF="16_1.html">Robert Koehler's         painting of a rainy evening on Hennepin Avenue</A> in 1902         provides a glimpse not only of the fashions of the day, but         also of such modern conveniences as the sidewalk and         electric streetcar. The sewn hide, colorful beaded design,         and hand-crafted bells of the <A HREF="14_1.html">Lakota         woman's dance dress</A> provide information about Lakota         traditions and lifestyle.</P>                  <P>Like any collection of images, the images presented here         tell only part of the story. Historically, art museums have         collected art primarily from western European societies,         while natural history and anthropological museums have         collected "cultural artifacts," which are in their own right         creative works of art. The distinctions between art and         artifact are now being broken down, however, and museums         throughout the United States, including The Minneapolis         Institute of Arts, are expanding their collections         accordingly. Because the Institute's current collection of         American art reflects the earlier philosophy and is,         therefore, decidedly slanted toward European-American art,         so is presentation. As the collection grows, artworks will         be added to reflect more fully America's diversity.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
