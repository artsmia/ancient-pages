Colonists brought tea with them to         North America, and the beverage appeared for sale in New         England as early as 1690. By the mid-18th century, tea was         the most popular social drink of European Americans.</P>                  <P>Because tea was very expensive, the ability to buy and         serve it signaled one's status and hospitality. Tradition         (especially English tradition) called for certain procedures         and etiquette when serving tea. The most important woman of         a household was expected to make the tea and pour it, and         her guests were expected to handle a teacup adeptly and         gracefully and to make lively conversation. Silversmiths         produced specialized implements for brewing and serving tea.         </P>                  <P>Tea is indissolubly linked to the events of the American         Revolution. Protesting unfair taxation, in 1773 colonists         boarded East India Company ships moored in Boston harbor and         dumped tea overboard. This incident became known as the         Boston Tea Party.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
