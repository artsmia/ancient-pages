Why did <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> paint the         horses in different colors? <B>(To show different kinds of         horses.)</B> Why might he have painted some of the horses         pink and blue even though horses are not these colors?         <B>(These were the colors he had available; they add visual         interest to the picture.)</B> Why do you think he did not         paint any of the horses black? <B>(He had to make them         different from the bison.)</B>  </P>                  <P>2. Why do you think <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>         painted all of the people alike, but represented horses in         so many different ways? <B>(Horses were very important to         Plains life; they were used for hunting, transportation,         trade.)</B></P>                  <P>3. Why are so many bison painted on this hide? <B>(Bison         traveled in herds; bison were very important to Plains         life.)</B> How did Plains people use the bison? <B>(For         everything they needed-food, shelter, clothing, tools,         etc.)</B>  </P>                  <P>4. Do you think <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> was         more interested in showing how things looked or in telling a         story? What makes you think so? </P>                  <P>5. Why might <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> have used         elk rather than bison hide for his painting at this time?         <B>(The bison herds had been destroyed by the European         Americans.)</B>  </P>                  <P>6. The nomadic way of life of the Plains people was         different from the lives of other Native Americans who         stayed in one place. How do you think the Plains lifestyle         affected the type of art that they made? <B>(Art had to be         portable, easy to move around; art had to be durable to         withstand being moved around.) </B></P>                  <P>7. When <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> painted this         hide, the Shoshone Indians were confined to a reservation         and their traditional way of life had all but vanished.Why         do you think he continued to paint traditional aspects of         Indian life? <B>(It was his artistic tradition; it helped         the people to remember their past; the paintings were         admired by non-Indian tourists and could be sold for         much-needed income.)</B></P>                  <P>8. Compare <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>'s Painted         Hide with <A HREF="24_2.html">Alexander Calder</A>'s         <A HREF="glossary.html#MOBILE">MOBILE</A>         <A HREF="24_1.html">Ahab</A>.
