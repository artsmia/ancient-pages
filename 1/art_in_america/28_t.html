Why might he have wanted this particular wood for         this work of art? Have you ever picked up wood on a shore?         What did it feel like?  </P>                  <P>2. Why do you suppose <A HREF="28_2.html">George         Morrison</A> used wood pieces of so many colors? Do you         think he painted the red and blue pieces himself, or did he         find them colored this way? Why do you think so?</P>                  <P>3. Do you think <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison</A> was         interested in recording a view of nature exactly as he saw         it? Why or why not? What do you think he was interested in?         From looking at this         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A>, can you         tell how <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison</A> feels about         nature?</P>                  <P>4. Why might <A HREF="28_2.html">Morrison</A> consider         this a "painting in wood"? Can a wooden         <A HREF="glossary.html#COLLAGE">COLLAGE</A> be a painting?         What if the artist says it is? </P>                  <P>5. When we are outside and we look into the distance, we         see the horizon. What is the horizon? We call the point at         which sky and land seem to meet visually the         <A HREF="glossary.html#HORIZON LINE">HORIZON LINE</A>. Does         the sky really touch the earth at this point? Why do you         think that the horizon was so interesting to         <A HREF="28_2.html">George Morrison</A>? He calls the         horizon an "enigma." Look that word up in the dictionary, or         discuss what it means. What aspects of the natural world         might you consider enigmas?  </P>                  <P>6. Think of one of your favorite places in nature. If you         were going to make a work of art about that place, would it         be abstract or         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>? Would         it have a lot of color or not? Would it be a painting or a         sculpture? Would you try to show things like wind or cold?         Movement? Light? </P>                  <P>7. Compare and contrast Morrison's         <B><A HREF="28_3.html">Collage IX: Landscape</A></B> to         <A HREF="25_1.html">Grace Hartigan's painting Billboard</A>.         Both artists lived in New York during the 1950s and were         influenced by many of the same things. How are their         paintings alike? How are they different? What would account         for the different approaches that artists take to making         their art?</P>                  <P><A HREF="28_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
