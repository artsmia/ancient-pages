He painted her face with no         attempt to <A HREF="glossary.html#IDEALIZE">IDEALIZE</A>         her.  Her well defined features-broad forehead, full lips,         strong pointed nose, and heavy eyebrows-give her a masculine         appearance and her piercing eyes boldly confront the viewer. She looks very serious.   </P>                  <P>Although <A HREF="4_3.html">Mrs. Allen</A>'s face is so         naturalistic, her figure, pose and elegant clothing are not         her own.  <A HREF="4_2.html">Copley</A> drew them from an         engraving that reproduced an English noblewoman's portrait         made several years earlier by the painter William Hogarth.          <A HREF="4_3.html">Mrs. Allen</A> may have chosen this         particular image from a selection of prints of stylish         English portraits. </P>                  <P>Since the engraving was black and white,         <A HREF="4_2.html">Copley</A> had to add color for his         painting.  The <A HREF="glossary.html#COOL COLORS">COOL         COLORS</A>, blue and green, dominate the portrait, but         golden and pink touches add a note of warmth.          <A HREF="4_2.html">Copley</A> modeled the figure in a wide         range of darks and lights to convey strong sense of volume.          He combined varying shades of white and gray with only         touches of color to represent the textures of her soft         leather gloves, lace ribbons, the pearl pins on her sleeve,         and the sheer chemise over her shoulders.  He used         especially deep shadows and white highlights to capture the         play of light reflections on the full sleeves and hoop skirt         of her blue satin dress.  Based on the same engraving as the         pose and dress, the scenery behind <A HREF="4_3.html">Mrs.         Allen</A> provides no insight into her life.  A blue and         pink-laced sky with trees below fill the painting's left         side.  To the right stands a tall leafy tree, lightly         rendered in pale greens, browns, and golds.<B><FONT         SIZE="+1"> <BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
