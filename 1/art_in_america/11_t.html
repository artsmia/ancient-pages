Why do you think Southwestern peoples began to make         pottery long ago? What kind of containers do you and your         family use to keep your food in? What are your containers         made of?</P>                  <P>2. Why do you think artists at <A HREF="11_3.html">Acoma         Pueblo</A> decorated their pottery? Are your containers         decorated as elaborately as this one? Why might you choose         to have decorated jars and containers in your home rather         than plain ones?</P>                  <P>3. Why do you think the artist chose to use the colors         you see on the pot? Would the pot look different if it had         been decorated with commercially manufactured colors such as         neon or fluorescent colors? How?</P>                  <P>4. This pot is recognizable as coming from         <A HREF="11_3.html">Acoma Pueblo</A> because of its form,         colors, and decorations. Each pueblo in New Mexico produces         a unique style of pottery. Why might it be important to a         group of people that they produce a unique and recognizable         style of pottery?</P>                  <P>5. An <A HREF="11_3.html">Acoma Pueblo</A> artist modeled         the design for this pot after a traditional water jar. How         big do you think the pot is? Traditionally the         <A HREF="11_3.html">Keresan</A> people at         <A HREF="11_3.html">Acoma Pueblo</A> carried water jars on         their heads. Does this information change your opinion about         the pot's size? If so, why?</P>                  <P>6. <A HREF="11_3.html">Acoma Pueblo</A> artists decorated         pots for use in the pueblo, but this pot was produced for         sale to tourists. Why would a Pueblo artist take the time to         decorate a pot with traditional designs for tourists? If you         were going to buy a piece of pottery from a culture other         than your own, would it be important to you that it look         "authentic" or traditional? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>7. Many modern-day potters in the Southwest continue to         make pottery in the tradition of their grandmothers and         great-grandmothers. What is a tradition? Do you have         traditions in your family that you can trace back to your         ancestors? Why would it be important for people to have         traditions that continue through generations of a family?         What are some ways that you think traditions are passed from         one generation to another?</P>                  <P>8. Compare the <A HREF="11_1.html">Acoma Pueblo Jar</A>         to the Templeman Tea Service detail. Look at the full         Templeman Tea Service set before looking at the detail. For         what purpose was each object used? What material is each         made of? Both of these containers are decorated with         <A HREF="glossary.html#LINEAR">LINEAR</A> designs. What         kinds of lines do you see on each object? How do the         decorations accent the shapes of the containers? Where in         each container do you see lines repeat to make patterns? How         was the decoration applied on each?</P>                  <P><A HREF="11_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~ Categories for Comparison ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
