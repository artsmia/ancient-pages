His portrait busts of U.S. presidents         George Washington and Andrew Jackson, as well as of other         famous people, were admired for their truthful         representation of the subject, which the artist combined         with the dress and dignity of a Roman senator or Greek         noble. By modeling portraits on ancient types, Powers         presented these leaders as moral and intellectual men who         were also politically powerful. His fame was almost         unprecedented for an American-born sculptor. During the         first half century of the United States' existence, nearly         all important         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMMISSION">COMMISSIONS</A> for         sculpture were given to European artists.</P>                  <P>Early Euro-American sculptors primarily carved stone         grave markers and wooden objects. Because no large-scale         stone tradition existed in the United States, Powers, like         other 19th-century sculptors, spent most of his career in         Italy. As a matter of course, American sculptors studied in         Rome, a city that had been home to renowned sculptural         traditions since ancient Roman times. Most artists also         established studios there because skilled assistants were         available to carve their designs in fine Italian         marbles.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
