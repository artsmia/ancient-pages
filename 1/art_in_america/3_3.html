When the room was         not in use, the furniture was placed against the walls. The         wall with the fireplace, which is the focal point of the         room, is more decorated than the others. The elaborate         <A HREF="glossary.html#MOLDING">MOLDING</A> surrounding the         picture over the mantle and the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BROKEN PEDIMENT">BROKEN PEDIMENT</A>         over the doorway are examples of British         <A HREF="glossary.html#ROCOCO">ROCOCO</A> design. Rococo         designs incorporated         <A HREF="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</A> and decorative         curving elements like the S-scrolls at the top of the         molding.</P>                  <P>The furnishings, like the architecture, reveal British         influence. Although made in the colonies, some of the         furniture emulates the style of British designer Thomas         Chippendale. For example, some of the gracefully curved legs         end in ball-and-claw feet, and intricate pierced details         decorate the <A HREF="glossary.html#SPLAT">SPLAT</A> backs         of some of the chairs. Most of the wood is mahogany, an         expensive imported wood favored for English furniture at         this time. The upholstered sofa and chairs offered great         comfort to the sitter. The upholstery matches the curtains,         as was often true in fashionable homes.</P>                  <P>Many items decorating the room provide insight into the         tastes of this period. Fashionable porcelain vases imported         from China are arranged on the mantle. A formal         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> of the Stuart         family or a family member probably hung above the fireplace.         (The portrait hanging there today is not originally from the         room.) To the left of the fireplace is an embroidered pole         screen used to shield women's faces so the fire's heat would         not melt their wax-based makeup. The large cut-glass         chandelier, wired for electricity today, held candles in the         18th century. Candles were very expensive at the time,         however, and were used with great economy.</P>                  <P>In the museum, the drawing-room furniture is arranged for         tea and conversation. The harp, chess set, pen and paper,         and tea service illustrate some of the leisure activities         available to the Stuart family and their friends. Tea was         the most popular social beverage of the day, and serving tea         was a mark of hospitality <A HREF="5_1.html">(see Templeman         Tea Service)</A>. This ceramic tea service imported from         England imitates Chinese porcelain.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
