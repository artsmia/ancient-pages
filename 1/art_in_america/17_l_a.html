Upon seeing this scene,         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> hurried to get his camera.         He wanted to take the picture before the man in the round         white hat, the man in the white crossed suspenders, and the         seated woman with a child changed their positions.

Where in this photograph do you see forms repeated?         <B>(The poles of the drawbridge, the curving chains of the         bridge, the steps and the railings of the stairs, the         bodies, heads, and hats of the crowd, the bars on the         upper-level railing, etc.)</B> Where do you see circles or         cylinders?<B> (Machine in lower left, funnel pipe,         semicircle that supports bridge, hat on upper deck, bottom         of boat mast.)</B> What forms in this photograph create a         large triangle? <B>(The ship mast, the funnel leaning left,         and the stairway leaning right.)</B></P>                  <P>7.
