Is this a heroic image of George Washington?  Why or         why not?  Would the         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> seem more or         less heroic if the President was sitting down?  Why?          Imagine that <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> had shown         Washington smiling.  How would this change the effect of the         portrait?  </P>                  <P>2. Why did <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> include         <A HREF="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A> references?         Do you see any classical references in your classroom?  What         are they?  Do you think they are         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLIC</A>, decorative, or         both?  Why?</P>                  <P>3. In 1987, the U.S. Congress formally acknowledged the         significant historical influence of the         <A HREF="6_5.html">Iroquois Confederacy of Nations</A> on         the U.S. Constitution.  Do you see any references to the         Native American Iroquois nations in this         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A>?  Why might         <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> have neglected to include any         references to the Iroquois? </P>                  <P>4. Why do you think <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> included         the billowing red curtain? The curtain is pulled aside to         let in the light of dawn and to reveal a rainbow.  What         might this <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLIZE</A> in         the context of this painting?<B> </B>     </P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> copied much of this         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> from a famous         painting by another artist, Gilbert Stuart.  Why might he         have done this?  <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A> made his copy         with Stuart's permission.  Why might Stuart have allowed         another artist to copy his painting?  Do you think a copy of         a portrait can be just as truthful as a portrait made from         life?  Why or why not? </P>                  <P>6. Compare <A HREF="6_2.html">Sully</A>'s         <A HREF="glossary.html#PORTRAIT">PORTRAIT</A> of George         Washington to <A HREF="4_1.html">Copley's formal portrait of         Mrs. Nathaniel Allen</A>.  In what ways are they alike?          What are the major differences?  What accounts for these         differences?  Consider:  subjects' positions in early         American society, gender, landscape setting vs. interior,         props, artistic sources, professional training of artists.         </P>                  <P><A HREF="4_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
