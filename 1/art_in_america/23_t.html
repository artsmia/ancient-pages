Do you think this is a happy picture? A sad picture?         Why do you think so?</P>                  <P>2. Why might <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> have painted         with such bright colors? How would it change the way the         painting affects you if she painted the whole ground brown         and green like the area in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A>?</P>                  <P>3. Why do you think <A HREF="23_3.html">Clementine         Hunter</A> chose to paint a scene of women doing the wash?         How would her painting be different if she made it today?         What activities from your life would you like to show in a         work of art?</P>                  <P>4. The <A HREF="23_5.html">African House</A> in         <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> painting was designed and         built according to one woman's recollections of her home in         Africa. What aspects of your household reflect the heritage         of members of your family? From what continents or countries         did your family come? How long ago? Have you ever visited         any of these places? What do you remember most about any of         these places?</P>                  <P>5. <A HREF="23_3.html">Clementine Hunter</A> is called a         <A HREF="glossary.html#FOLK ART">FOLK ARTIST</A>. What does         the word "folk" mean? Why might certain types of art be         called folk art? Some people argue that folk art is not         really art. Why might they think this? Do you think folk art         should be considered art?  What do you like best about         <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> folk painting?</P>                  <P>6. Compare <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter's</A> image of         women working on a southern plantation to other images of         women in this presentation (<A HREF="4_1.html">Mrs.         Nathaniel Allen</A>; woman in <A HREF="16_1.html">Rainy         Evening on Hennepin Avenue</A>; women in         <A HREF="17_1.html">The Steerage</A>;          <A HREF="21_html">Migrant Mother;</A> woman in         <A HREF="20_1.html">Harlem Couple</A>;         <A HREF="26_1.html">Homage to Nina Simone.</A>) What are the         different women doing? How old do you think the women are?         How does each artist convey this to you? How does their         clothing differ? What might account for these differences?         How do their different appearances, clothing, and activities         reflect the varied roles of women throughout the history of         the United States? How do the time periods in which the art         works were created affect the way the women are portrayed?         </P>                  <P>7.

What do these paintings have in common? How does         the use of color differ? How does each artist show depth?         Why do you think <A HREF="23_3.html">Hunter</A> is often         called a <A HREF="glossary.html#FOLK ART">FOLK ARTIST</A>         while <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson</A> is not?
