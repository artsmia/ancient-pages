What is this dress made of? How can you tell? What is         the bright-colored area of the dress made of? How can you         tell?</P>                  <P>2. How many different colors of beads would you need to         make this dress? Which color would you need the most of? How         many beads would you need to make this dress?</P>                  <P>3. This dress has a         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</A> for a turtle on         it. Can you guess which symbol refers to the turtle? The         design on the yoke of this dress is called         turtle-by-the-shore-of-the-lake. What represents the         lakeshore in the design? How is the lake itself represented?         </P>                  <P>4. The Lakota artist who beaded this dress made an         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</A> that stands for         the turtle. Abstract means that certain features are         exaggerated and other details are left out. What features of         the turtle did this artist exaggerate? What features or         details did she leave out?</P>                  <P>5. What other decorations do you see on this dress?
