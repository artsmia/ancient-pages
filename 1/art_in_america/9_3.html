A growing commercial market in the         industrialized eastern United States also encouraged many         painters to document and glorify the western wilderness.            </P>                  <P>Henry Lewis made this landscape painting of St. Anthony         Falls in his studio in Dusseldorf, Germany.  He based it on         a sketch he had done seven years earlier when he floated         down the Mississippi River on a makeshift pontoon made from         two canoes and a platform.  A commercial pragmatist, Lewis         wanted to paint a huge         <A HREF="glossary.html#PANORAMA">PANORAMA</A> of scenes of         the river on a long roll of canvas.  As it unfolded, the         painting would give viewers the sense of actually floating         down the river.  With this panorama, he could fulfill the         role of the 19th-century artist as documenter of the land         while also capitalizing on the public's eagerness to see         such grand paintings.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
