Government officials wanted to extend American         authority over areas still under British influence. They         acquired the land on which the fort is built from the Dakota         Indians earlier in the century. (According to Dakota oral         tradition, the meeting place of the Mississippi and         Minnesota rivers is the sacred site of their origin, where         Mother Earth gave birth to the ancestors of their people.)         Begun in 1820 under the direction of Josiah Snelling and         completed in 1824, the fort was constructed of limestone         from nearby bluffs and logs cut at a sawmill located at St.         Anthony Falls.</P>                  <P>The occupation of Fort Snelling by soldiers and their         families marked the beginning of permanent settlement by         European Americans in the Minnesota territory. The settlers         began to plant crops that eventually made Minnesota a leader         in the flour milling industry. Villages such as Mendota grew         up around the fort. During the ten years following the         fort's construction, more than 100,000 new settlers moved to         Minnesota.<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
