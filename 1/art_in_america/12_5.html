In the upper right and left hand corners         and the lower left, men butcher the bison on the field. They         separate the hide from the carcass and prepare the meat to         take back to camp for food. The other parts of the animal         are set aside for a variety of purposes. For example, the         <A HREF="12_2.html">Plains Indians</A> boiled the bison's         hooves (visible in the upper and lower left and to the far         right) to make glue.   </P>                  <P>At the center of the painting is a forked pole with a         bison head attached and an eagle hovering above it. This         represents the center pole of the sun dance-the most sacred         ceremony of the <A HREF="12_2.html">Plains Indians</A>. The         poses of the men around the pole, however, indicate that         they are performing a social dance called a wolf dance. They         wear headdresses called roaches, feather bustles hanging         from their waists and backs, and bells attached to their         knees and ankles.</P>                  <P>The man astride the spotted pinto horse to the left wears         a long feather headdress, probably made from the feathers of         the golden eagle. This proclaims his heroic deeds and status         in the society. Five other men seated on the ground beat a         drum, considered the heartbeat of the people. To their         right, a woman carries her child on her back in a         traditional cradleboard. Surrounding the activity are         tepees, portable homes made of poles and hide. </P>                  <P><A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A> described all of the         figures and objects with fluid black contour lines and         colored them with bright commercially prepared paints. He         used different colored paints, including red, pink, and         bright blue, to distinguish various breeds of horses. The         artist greatly varied the horses' appearance, but made the         people look alike. Only their colorful shirts distinguish         them from one another. <A HREF="12_4.html">Cadzi Cody</A>'s         composition is very active, with every figure in motion. All         of the activity circles around the central scene. Further,         the deep black bison and the colorful horses keep the         viewers' eyes moving across the hide.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
