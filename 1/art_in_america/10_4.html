It is merely a distant landmark         dwarfed by the vast expanse of wilderness. He probably         included it to entice a prospective buyer or to please a         hotel patron who wanted a souvenir. The real subject of the         painting is nature.</P>                  <P><A HREF="10_2.html">Cropsey</A> used several         compositional devices to convey the unbounded space of the         Catskills. By making the sky take up nearly half of the         painting, he stressed the horizontal expanse of the land.         The <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND">FOREGROUND</A> to the         right offers the viewer an elevated vantage point from which         to take in the scene. Changes in color lead a viewer's eyes         from the twisted tree and rocks in the foreground to the         lake and resort in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>, and         finally to the mountain, valley, and sky in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>. Using         atmospheric perspective, the artist blurred the edges and         softened the colors of the forms in the background to         represent the way objects actually appear in the distance.         </P>                  <P><A HREF="10_2.html">Cropsey's</A> elevated viewpoint is         typical of most <A HREF="10_2.html">Hudson River School</A>         paintings. It visually expresses the political philosophy of         the time, Manifest Destiny, which proposed that European         Americans were destined by God to civilize, tame, and         dominate this land.</P>                  <P>The red and golden foliage show that it is autumn,         <A HREF="10_2.html">Cropsey's</A> favorite season. Wispy         clouds weave in and out of the distant peaks, emphasizing         the height of the mountains. The dead trees in the         foreground represent the wilderness. In contrast, the         <A HREF="glossary.html#NEOCLASSICISM">NEOCLASSICAL</A> hotel         represents civilization and humankind's ability to impose         order on nature. A few birds in the branches of the dead         tree are the only other signs of life in this vast         landscape.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
