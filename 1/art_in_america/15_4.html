Although he was         only 11 years old in 1865, he commemorated the events of         that year in the painting <B>Reminiscences of 1865</B>, done         some 35 years later. The varied images in this painting         probably reflect personal as well as historical concerns.         </P>                  <P>What we see is actually just paint on a flat canvas.         Through a precise rendering of details,         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> created the illusion of actual         objects on a worn wooden door. The focal point is the         black-and-white image of Lincoln that         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> reproduced from an         <A HREF="glossary.html#ENGRAVING">ENGRAVING</A> of a         photograph. It gives the appearance of being an actual         photograph stuck to the door with a brass tack. Adjacent to         the image, Lincoln's nickname, Abe, appears to be carved in         <A HREF="glossary.html#SUNKEN RELIEF">SUNKEN RELIEF</A> into         the door, as does the year of his death. His birth year,         1809, gives the appearance of being carved in         <A HREF="glossary.html#RAISED RELIEF">RAISED RELIEF</A> so         that the numbers stand out from the door.</P>                  <P>Currency was a favorite subject of         <A HREF="glossary.html#STILL LIFE">STILL LIFE</A> painters         in this age obsessed with money. (This was a time when         fortunes could be made, despite the poverty of many.) In         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto's</A> painting, a 25-cent         "shinplaster," a worthless piece of paper money, is attached         below a tarnished coin. The image of the man on the         shinplaster is Robert Walker, who was Secretary of the         Treasury under Lincoln and an avowed abolitionist. His image         may refer to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which         technically freed slaves in Confederate territories in 1862.         </P>                  <P>Everything in this painting shows the signs of time. The         painted door is weathered, the lock is broken and rusted,         the nails are bent. The photograph's edges curl, and only         tattered pieces of paper remain, the rest having been torn         away or worn off. The paint around these papers is clearly         more faded than that which lay underneath, protected from         the sun, possibly for decades. Beside the papers, faded         columns of numbers written in chalk are barely visible.         <A HREF="15_2.html">Peto</A> arranged these elements within         the rectangular design of the door to create a sense of         order. The muted greens and tans reinforce the worn and         weathered appearance of the objects and the door.<BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="10%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
