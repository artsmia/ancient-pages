What is the main subject of <A HREF="9_3.html">Henry         Lewis</A>'s painting? Why do you think so?</P>                  <P>2. <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> spent a long time looking         at and sketching scenes along the Mississippi River.  Does         this <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> look         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A> or         imaginary? Why do you think so? A sawmill and other         buildings were located at the falls when         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> painted this.  Are any         buildings visible in this scene?  How then is this painting         also imaginary?  Why might <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> have         left out any signs of development?<B>   </B></P>                  <P> 3. Where is the site of <A HREF="9_2.html">St. Anthony         Falls</A>?  Have you ever visited this place?  If so, what         aspects of the site would you include in a painting?  What         details would you consider leaving out?  Why?  If you could         choose any site for a         <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> painting,         what site would you choose?  Why?  Which of the techniques         used by <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> might you like to use         in your painting?</P>                  <P>4. Why might <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> have included         an American Indian in his scene? Why do you think he chose         to show the Indian wearing red? How would the composition         change if the figure was not included?  This representation         of an Indian reflects a romanticized Euro-American notion of         the Native American relationship to nature.  This area, the         traditional homeland of the Dakota, was not always peaceful. What impact did white settlement have on the native peoples who         lived on this land?  Why might artists like         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> neglect to show this reality?         </P>                  <P>5. Compare and contrast Henry Lewis's St. Anthony Falls         to <A HREF="10_1.html">Jasper Cropsey's Catskill Mountain         House</A>, both painted in 1855.  In what ways are their         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITIONS</A> alike?         Why do you think half of each of these paintings is devoted         to sky?  Which artwork appears more         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>?  Why? 19th-century <A HREF="glossary.html#LANDSCAPE">LANDSCAPE</A> artists         often changed what an area actually looked like to fit         formulas for popular paintings.  Do you think         <A HREF="9_3.html">Lewis</A> and         <A HREF="10_2.html">Cropsey</A> did this?  What makes you         think so?</P>                  <P><A HREF="9_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
