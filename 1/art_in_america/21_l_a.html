Who is the most important person in this photograph?         <B>(Mother.)</B> How is attention drawn to her? <B>(She is         the largest figure; she is in the middle; hers is the only         face clearly visible.)</B>  </P>                  <P>2. How many children do you see in this photograph?         <B>(Three.)</B> How are they related to the woman? <B>(They         are her children.)</B> What makes you think so?</P>                  <P>3. What clues do you see in this photograph that tell you         this family is going through hard times? <B>(Mother's facial         expression, the figures' ragged, dirty clothes, their body         language.)</B></P>                  <P>4. Look closely. Can you see a triangle suggested by the         arrangement of the figures? What parts of the figures form         the sides? Where is the triangle's point?</P>                  <P>5. An <A HREF="glossary.html#IMPLIED LINE">IMPLIED         LINE</A> is a line that is visually suggested by the         arrangement of forms. Where did Lange use implied lines in         this photograph? <B>(One implied line runs from center top         to bottom, and another runs from center left to right.)</B>         Where do these implied lines meet? <B>(In the photo's         center.)</B></P>                  <P>6. When a photographer "frames" a photograph, she or he         chooses what to include within the edges of the photograph,         as well as what to leave out. What has         <A HREF="21_4.html">Dorothea Lange</A> left out of this         photograph? <B>(Parts of the figures' bodies, part of the         post in the lower right, and clues to their setting.)<FONT         SIZE="+1"><BR>                  </FONT></B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
