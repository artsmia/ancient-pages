What is going on in this painting? How many figures         are there? How many of them are children? How many red         figures do you count? Blue? Pink? Yellow? Red-violet? This         painting celebrates a singer named <A HREF="26_4.html">Nina         Simone</A>. Which figure represents the singer? How can you         tell? Name at least three ways that the artist,         <A HREF="26_2.html">Bob Thompson</A>, has drawn attention to         her.</P>                  <P>2. What kind of day is it in this picture? How can you         tell? What might the temperature be?</P>                  <P>3. Name five things from nature in this scene. Does the         scene look natural? What about it looks natural? What does         not look natural?</P>                  <P>4. An outline or         <A HREF="glossary.html#CONTOUR">CONTOUR</A> line is a line         that describes the outside edge of an object or figure.         Where do you see outlines in this picture? Does it look like         <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> painted the outlines or the         figures themselves first? What makes you think so? Does the         outline method make the figures appear flat or         <A HREF="glossary.html#THREE-DIMENSIONAL">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</A>?         What else about these figures makes them look so flat?</P>                  <P>5. What object is farthest away from us in this painting?         How can you tell? Which figure is closest? How can you tell?         </P>                  <P>6. <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A> based his         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A> on a         painting by a French painter who regularly used triangles in         his pictures to give them stability. Thompson has also used         triangles. Where do you see triangles in this composition?         Which of the figure groups form triangles? Is this picture         calm or lively? How has <A HREF="26_2.html">Thompson</A>         created a lively composition even though he has used so many         triangles?</P>                  <P><A HREF="26_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
