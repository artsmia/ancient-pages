What things of value are made of metal? Why might a         tea set made of silver be more valuable than a tea set made         of clay?</P>                  <P>2. Why do you think silversmiths were among the most         respected and well-paid artisans in the American colonies?         </P>                  <P>3. Why isn't the teapot's handle made of silver?</P>                  <P>4. Why do you think the tea caddy has a lock? Why was tea         so expensive? Do you recall how the colonists protested         England's tax on tea?</P>                  <P>5. Do people still drink tea? How is tea preparation and         service different today? What other beverages have become         popular today? How are they prepared and served?</P>                  <P>6. What special dishes or serving pieces do you have in         your home that are reserved for use on special occasions or         for special guests? What kinds of occasions does your family         celebrate by serving special foods or beverages?</P>                  <P>7. Compare the pieces in this tea service to the         <A HREF="13_1.html">Seneca Indian feast ladle</A>. What         materials were these objects made of? How were they made?         Who made them? What is similar about their shape or         composition? What is different? What kinds of decoration do         you see? How were the decorations applied? What kinds of         food were these objects used to serve? Were they made for         use by an individual or groups of people? How can you tell?         Did the people who made and used these objects mean them to         be works of art? What makes you think so?</P>                  <P><A HREF="5_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
