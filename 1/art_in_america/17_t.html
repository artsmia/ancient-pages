What do you think attracted         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> most to this scene? What         about the photograph attracts you the most?</P>                  <P>2. Imagine that the man in the round white hat on the         upper deck was not there. How would his absence change the         picture? How would the picture be different if he had lifted         his head up so that his hat could not be seen? Why do you         think it was so important to         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> that the straw hat         remained in this position?</P>                  <P>3. Why might <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> have         wanted to emphasize the group rather than individuals in         this photograph?</P>                  <P>4. Do you think these people knew their picture was being         taken? If you were in their situation, would you want your         picture taken? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>5. By the early 1900s <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A>         was making         <A HREF="glossary.html#STRAIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY">STRAIGHT         PHOTOGRAPHS</A> - photographs that are exposed and printed         without special techniques that alter their appearance. He         wanted to capture his subjects as they appeared at the time         he took the photographs. How would the impact of         <A HREF="17_4.html">The Steerage</A> be different if         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> had added color to it? If         he had made it look more foggy? If he had printed the whole         photo much darker?</P>                  <P>6. When <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> was working,         many Americans did not accept photography as an art form         equal to painting or sculpture.         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> insisted that it was. Do         you consider <A HREF="17_4.html">The Steerage</A> a work of         art? Why or why not? Why aren't all photographs considered         works of art? Do you think any photograph considered a work         of art by its maker is automatically a work of art? Can a         photograph taken for pleasure with no artistic intent be         considered a work of art?</P>                  <P>7. What does <A HREF="17_4.html">The Steerage</A> tell         about the people represented in it?         <A HREF="17_3.html">Stieglitz</A> photographed these         immigrants in the lower (steerage) level of a fashionable         ship on a trip from the United States to Europe. Why would         immigrants be on a boat headed to Europe?</P>                  <P>8. Compare the arrangements of light and dark in Alfred         Stieglitz's photograph with those in         <A HREF="28_1.html">George Morrison's Collage IX:         Landscape</A>. How are light and dark used similarly? How         does each artist use repeated shapes in his         <A HREF="glossary.html#COMPOSITION">COMPOSITION</A>? Do they         use any of the same related shapes? Which ones? Why do you         think each artist chose his         <A HREF="glossary.html#MEDIUM">MEDIUM</A>? What are the         advantages of each medium for creating a composition that         focuses on light and dark contrasts and shapes?</P>                  <P><A HREF="17_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
