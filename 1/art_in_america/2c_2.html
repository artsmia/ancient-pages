This chest         is called a Connecticut chest because it resembles a type of         chest popular in the Connecticut River valley during the         18th century.  </P>                  <P>The chest is made of oak and has a hinged pine lid.          Carvings on the front panel create the illusion of three         square panels separated by two         <A HREF="glossary.html#BALUSTER">BALUSTERS</A>.  Each         baluster is a spindle that was made on a lathe, cut in half,         and glued to the surface.  The balusters were painted black         to resemble ebony, a hard, dark wood from Asia that was very         expensive.  The round decoration at the center of each         square, also painted black, is called a boss.  Carved wood         around and within each square creates a decorative         arch.<B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
