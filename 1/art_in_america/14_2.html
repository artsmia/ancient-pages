During the 17th century, encroachment by         Euro-American settlers, as well as other Indian peoples,         forced the Lakota to move westward. They gradually adapted         to life on the Plains and developed a distinct culture. The         Lakota acquired horses, introduced to North America by the         Spanish in the 17th century, and, by the 18th century, had         become nomadic bison hunters. Today, a major center of         Lakota culture is in South Dakota near the Black Hills.         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
