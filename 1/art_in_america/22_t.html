How do you think these men are feeling? What in the         painting makes you think so? Why might         <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden</A> have shown them this way?         Why might he have chosen not to show them actually working         in the factory?</P>                  <P>2. Why did <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden</A> include the         factory in this picture? Why did he place the factory in the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>, rather         than closer to the viewer? Why did         <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden</A> use         <A HREF="glossary.html#ORGANIC">ORGANIC</A> forms and         subdued colors to describe the men, and         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> forms and         starker colors for the factory?</P>                  <P>3. <A HREF="22_4.html">Bearden's</A>         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A> is called         <A HREF="glossary.html#SOCIAL REALISM">SOCIAL REALISM</A>.         Discuss the words "social" and "realism." What do you         suppose this term means? Based on this painting, what         characteristics might you guess make a work of art social         realist? Art that made social commentary was popular during         the Depression of the 1930s and throughout World War II. Why         do you think this was so? To help answer this question,         compare <A HREF="24_1.html">Alexander Calder's mobile         Ahab</A> to Bearden's painting. Consider: Which one would be         more relevant or readily understandable to a larger         population? Which one tells more about the concerns of the         times?</P>                  <P>4. <A HREF="22_4.html">Romare Bearden</A> painted this         picture with <A HREF="glossary.html#GOUACHE">GOUACHE</A> on         paper to illustrate a magazine article. Do you consider         illustration a form of art? Why or why not? If you had to         pick a favorite illustration, what would you pick? Do you         consider your favorite illustration a work of art? In your         mind, what makes or would make an illustrator an artist?         </P>                  <P>5. Compare Bearden's Factory Workers to         <A HREF="21_1.html">Dorothea Lange's <B>Migrant         Mother</A></B> and <A HREF="23_1.html">Clementine Hunter's         <B>The Wash</A></B>. What can you tell about the workers in         each picture? Do you think these artworks dignify the         workers? Why or why not? Which of the images seems the most         personal? Why?</P>                  <P><A HREF="22_t_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><B><BR>                  </B>         <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the                  Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A>                  ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
