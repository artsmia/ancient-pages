What items do you see in this room? Does the room look         crowded? Why or why not?</P>                  <P>2. Where do you see wood in this room? Where do you see         metal? Where do you see glass? Where do you see paint?</P>                  <P>3. What kinds of lines dominate this room? Where do you         see straight lines in this room? Look very closely. Where do         you see curving lines? Does the emphasis of the room seem to         be more horizontal or vertical? Why?</P>                  <P>5. What is <A HREF="glossary.html#TEXTURE">TEXTURE</A>?         What texture would the floors be? Stucco is a plaster or         cement finish for walls. Which parts of the room are stucco?         What do you think these walls feel like? What clues do you         get from the image?</P>                  <P>6. The electric lights in the ceiling of this room would         not have been there originally since electricity had not yet         been invented in the 18th century. Where would the light in         this room have come from? Where would you go in this room if         you wanted to read during the day? Where would you go if you         wanted to read in the evening?</P>                  <P><A HREF="2a_l_a.html">Teacher Answer Key</A><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><A HREF="to_the_teacher.html">To the Teacher</A> ~ <A HREF="intro.html">Introduction</A> ~ <A HREF="timeline_1.html">Timeline</A> ~  <A HREF="image_index.html">Artwork                  Index</A> ~                  <A HREF="categories_comparison.html">Categories for                  Comparison</A> ~                  <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~ Your Comments</CENTER>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
