Information Access?</b></font></p>      <p>ArtsConnectEd and the Integrated Arts Information Access Project are         complementary, interdependent collaborations between The Minneapolis Institute         of Arts and the Walker Art Center that provide online access to the rich         collections and reference, archive, media, and curriculum resources of         both institutions through one shared point of entry (Web page). There         is no other project in the United States and only a few in the world where         two art museums are collaborating in such depth to create a single point         of access to their multiple resources. </p>      <p>The Integrated Arts Information Access Project (IAIA) was launched in         September 1997, following the award of a $1 million grant from the State         of Minnesota Department of Children, Families, and Learning through an         appropriation by the Minnesota State Legislature. IAIA supports the technical,         academic, and production processes necessary to develop, convert, and         retrieve information resources from both institutions, as well as the         production of new educational content. </p>      <p>ArtsConnectEd (ACE) was initiated in May 1998 when MCI awarded a $150,000         grant to support access to these multiple resources through the development         of a central homepage and specialized query tools and indices. MCI also         provides funding for marketing ArtsConnectEd, teacher training, and in         some instances, dial-in Internet accounts for teachers and students in         remote areas where Internet access is severely limited. In June of 2000         ArtsConnectEd received an additional award of a $1 million grant fromthe         State of Minnesota Department of Children, Families, and Learning through         an appropriation by the Minnesota State Legislature, This appropriation         will be used to support statewide teacher training , continue the process         of digitizing the collections and to further the development of additional         educational resources. Current funding will continue to support these         efforts through June 2001. </p>      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to list of questions</a></p>      <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><a name="question2"></a>How do I access these         resources? </b></font></p>      <p>ArtsConnectEd and IAIA can be accessed from either institution's Web         site or directly through www.artsconnected.org. </p>      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to list of questions</a></p>      <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><a name="question3"></a>Who are they designed         for?</b> </font></p>      <p>These projects are being developed as a primary resource for K-12 teachers,         students, parents, and researchers throughout Minnesota. While designed         primarily for educational applications, the site can be freely accessed         worldwide by the general public through www.artsconnected.org. </p>      <p>Teachers are able to use the ACE site to search for and access art-related         curriculum materials and student activities according to grade level,         subject matter, and the Minnesota Graduation Standards. Teachers can also         access and participate in online discussions between school and museum         educators. Students can use ACE to conduct school project-related research         as well as participate in curriculum-related online activities and discussions.         Students, families, and the general public at large can use ACE to explore         the expansive collections and resources of both museums through online         tours and browsing.</p>      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to list of questions</a></p>      <p><a name="question4"></a><b><font color="#CC0000">What kinds of information         and media can be found through ArtsConnectEd?</font></b></p>      <p> ArtsConnectEd contains a tremendous diversity of information resources         including: text, images, audio, video, hypermedia, 3-D models and animation         related to collection information, library card catalogues, object label         and didactic panel copy, exhibition and institutional archives, educational         materials, and full-text publications. </p>      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to list of questions</a></p>      <p><b><font color="#CC0000"><a name="question5"></a>What curriculum resources         are available? </font></b></p>      <p>As an additional component of this collaboration, each institution is         developing online curriculum materials and educational modules that both         technically and intellectually draw upon the information within the database.         These materials fill existing instructional needs as well as demonstrate         the tremendous future potential for teachers and students to create their         own content through the integration of online resources into their classroom         activities. </p>      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to list of questions</a></p>      <p><b><font color="#CC0000"><a name="question6"></a>How is ArtsConnectEd         related to ArtsNet Minnesota?</font></b> </p>      <p>ArtsNet Minnesota is a collaborative educational project involving The         Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R.         Weisman Art Museum, and the Minnesota Museum of American Art.
