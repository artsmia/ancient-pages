        completes construction and begins unveiling several new public spaces 
        for the increased comfort and enjoyment of its visitors. A large community 
        meeting room is now available for public programs, including classes, 
        lectures and meetings. A Family Center now provides space for art activities 
        and relaxation for children and families after a stimulating visit to 
        the museum. Also, in mid-September you can expect to see the completed 
        reinstallation of the 20th century collections in the East Wing of the 
        second floor, the Sculpture Court area, and an expanded space for the 
        Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program. And for your shopping pleasure, 
        the new Museum Shop, is already operating in its new location with twice 
        the space! We hope you enjoy these exciting changes and that they will 
        enhance your next museum visit.</P>
