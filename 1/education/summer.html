Our brain interprets         these images to help us integrate what we see into our daily lives. But         how often do we really LOOK at what we&#146;re seeing?</p>      <p>Learning to read images, like learning to read books, is a skill that         requires time and practice. In our image-rich world, the habits of careful         looking can be applied beyond the walls of the art museum. Looking at         art is an enjoyable way to practice essential critical thinking and communication         skills.</p>      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teachers taking The Art         of Looking will</font></b></p>      <ul>        <li>Practice careful looking in the galleries of The Minneapolis Institute           of Arts</li>        <li>Refine their vocabulary for talking about art</li>        <li>Investigate the process of perception</li>        <li>Observe how the choices artists make impact perception</li>        <li>Explore ways to use art in the classroom to develop visual literacy           and critical thinking skills in support of the Minnesota Graduation           Standards</li>      </ul>      <p><i>Graduate credit (4 semester credits) is available through Hamline         University for an additional $294.</i></p>      <blockquote>        <p><a href="summer_reg.html">You can print a registration page online.</a></p>      </blockquote>      <p><i>Contact Kate Peterson at (612) 870-3013 for more information.</i><br>      </p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
