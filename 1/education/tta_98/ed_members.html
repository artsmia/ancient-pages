Our newest           on-line curriculum unit, World Ceramics, was developed through the Integrated           Arts Information Access Project (IAIA). A resource for teachers and           students, the ceramics unit includes role-playing and inquiry activities           for learners at all levels.

ArtsConnectEd           will lead the user to a database of collections and curriculum information           from both museums that includes images, text archives, videos, audio,           and related software. Our goal is to make arts education timely, engaging,           interactive, and pertinent for both teachers and students. Teachers           will be especially interested in the curriculum materials produced by           the museums, and students can use the resources for self-paced learning.           ArtsConnectEd can be accessed from either museum's web site or directly           by visiting www.ArtsConnectEd.org. ArtsConnectEd is a partnership made           possible by generous grants from MCI and the Department of Children,           Families, and Learning. </p>      </blockquote>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6600"><b>ArtReach         Centers</b></font>       <blockquote>        <p>Many of our curriculum materials are available free of charge at several           sites in Minnesota.
