Tours encourage students         to discuss their own opinions and observations about art from around the         world. A question as simple as What's going on in this picture? can elicit         surprisingly different responses. Questions like Why do you think the         artist chose to paint the sky yellow? or How would the sculpture look         if it were clay instead of wood? invite students to think analytically         and to share their responses with others.       <p>Most tours last about one hour. Tours fill quickly, so call early. Best         bets are fall and winter. (Many of our spring tours are completely booked         by late fall.) All tours are free, except writing tours and workshops.       <p>Please call:       <blockquote>        <p>(612) 870-3140 To schedule a tour <br>          (612) 870-3134 To reserve a related video or slide set <br>          (612) 870-3206 or 870-3074 To plan a writing activity, arrange a tour           series, or plan a unique field trip </p>      </blockquote>      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC6600">How to Schedule         a Tour </font></h3>      <p>Call at least four weeks in advance, Tuesday through Friday, 8:30 a.m.&#150;5         p.m., and tell us:       <ul>        <li>Date and time         <li>Alternate date and time         <li>Number in group         <li>Name of school or organization         <li>Subject of tour         <li>Name of teacher or group leader         <li>Teacher's or leader's home telephone number         <li>Telephone number and address of school or organization         <li>Special requests       </ul>      <p>We'll let you know how to prepare your group and how to borrow a pre-tour         video when you call to book a tour.
