         <P>Once an exhibit is built, its builder has the option of
         publishing it for others to view. Each published exhibit is
         assigned a number called an exhibit code. The builder can
         give this code to anyone he or she wants to view the
         published exhibit. This code system is designed to give the
         builder control of how their exhibits are distributed.</P>
         
         <P>To view a published exhibit, type in the exhibit code in
         the box below and click the "View Exhibit" buttton.</P>
