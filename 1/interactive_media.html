The programs are presented on         Macintosh computers, and in most cases, the graphics,         animation, audio, and programming are stored directly on the         computer's hard disk. Some of the programs use a videodisc         player to display video sequences. The monitors are         touch-sensitive and allow the visitor to make choices and         navigate through the programs at his or her own pace.</P>                  <P>The production of these programs was funded through a         generous grant from the General Mills Foundation.</P>                          <P>For more information on The Minneapolis Institute of Arts Interactive           Media programs contact the Interactive Media Group (612) 870-3211, Email:           <I> <A HREF="mailto:miagen@artsMIA.org">miagen@artsMIA.org</A> </I>.         </P>                          </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p></P></BODY></HTML>
