In the 16th century virtuosity,           then equated with great facility of execution, and the overcoming of           complex and difficult problems, was highly prized in the arts, in literature,           as well as in human decorum. An obsession with virtuosity and elegance,           then, was the guiding force of mannerism, essentially an artificial,           anti-naturalistic style. To repeat a much-quoted phrase, Mannerism is           a 'stylish' style. Because it transgressed moderation, Mannerism appealed           to an elite class of connoisseurs, not to the general populace. <br>          </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">           Mannerism as a distinct and distinguishable style first appeared in           Rome in about 1520; it was transported to Florence in about 1522- 23           and to other Italian cities in that same decade. Mannerism, by now an           international fashion, was transplanted to Fontainebleau in 1530, where           it was put to service in the creation of French court art. Mannerism           ran its erratic course until about 1590, by which time it had been substantially           supplanted by the clearer and more uniform ideals of the early Baroque.           And while we are primarily concerned with painting here, we should bear           in mind that for a good part of the 16th century Mannerism was also           the prevailing trend in architecture, sculpture, literature, and music.           <br>          </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">           The notion of mannerism as a separate style sandwiched in between the           dying High Renaissance and the dynamic Baroque era is a relatively recent           phenomenon. Certainly a 16th century artist was not aware that he was           living in a designated time period or working in a designated style,           in the same way that 20th century artists are aware. Most art criticism           from the 17th to the 19th centuries perceived such a divergence, however,           and generally discounted this interim period as decadent and perverse.           Only around 1920 was such a sweeping condemnation reversed, and the           merits and complexities of this neglected period studied and appreciated.           The name Mannerism is really an umbrella term that attempts to consolidate           its many facets, since so many different centers of artistic production,           conflicting trends, varieties of patrons, and individual idioms are           involved. <br>          </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">           Various and contradictory definitions and interpretations have been           proposed for Mannerism. It has been construed as a reaction against           the ideals of the High Renaissance, as an expression of the spiritual           crisis of the time, or as a sophisticated art created solely for art's           sake, exemplifying the aesthetic theories of the 16th century. In fact,           all of these theories are valid, presenting parallel, rather than incompatible,           explanations of the many manifestations of this consciously ambiguous           means of expression. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>           </b></font> </p>        </div>      </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font color="#000000"> </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
