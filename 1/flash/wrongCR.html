The         canvas is attached with tacks to a nine-member replacement keyable stretcher         which appears to date from the time of the present restoration. Outer         stretcher members are 4 3/4" wide and 1 3/4" deep.The canvas is lined         overall with what appears to be an aqueous glue/paste adhesive. The lining         appears to consist of two layers of an open weave, fairly heavy weight,         plain weave gauze canvas.<br>        </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Condition: The stretcher is         very well constructed with wide members and keys at all joins. The stretcher         is more than adequate for a painting of this size and weight. It appears         that the painting's tacking edges have been trimmed from all edges. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The canvas and lining are         in poor condition. The canvas is delaminated from the lining material         in several large areas, most noticeable in the upper fourth of the painting         at the left. The canvas and lining is very severely bulged in several         areas, the largest of which is located in the bottom third of the painting.         Importantly, the bulges become more pronounced with increased relative         humidity. In addition, the painting is quite slack on the stretcher; little         or no tension is present on the canvas and lining. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the condition of the         canvas and lining, it can be assumed that the glue/paste adhesive is failing         due to age, the amount of adhesive used in the lining process, and/or         the lining techniques utilized. Overall, the painting surface is somewhat         disfigured by a strong weave impression. The weave of the original canvas         has been enhanced by the heat, moisture, and pressure used in the glue/paste         lining process. The weave impression is a permanent deformation and cannot         be removed or reduced.</font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Interestingly, on a 1967         Intermuseum Conservation Association condition card for the Castiglione,         Richard Buck notes that the canvas was slack and that restoration was         darkened. By 1968, the areas of delamination of canvas from lining material         is mentioned and mapped on the card.</font></p>      <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>PAINT AND GROUND LAYERS</b>         </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Construction: The broadly         woven canvas is primed with what appears to be a red earth colored ground.         The paint layer is characteristic of an oil bound medium and has been         applied quite directly and broadly, utilizing wet-into-wet techniques.</font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Condition: The paint and         ground layers are in fairly good condition. In the bottom fourth of the         painting, there are numerous, large losses which are unfilled and toned         a uniform dark brown color. The losses are somewhat localized, suggesting         that the damage may be related to handling or, perhaps, loss due to exposure         to water or moisture. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are scattered smaller         losses throughout the painting. Some retouching has been executed in what         appears to be a synthetic resin medium with zinc white pigment. The areas         have blanched, making the retouching visible from viewing distance. The         more finely executed retouching appears in the upper half of the painting.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In more thinly painted areas,         the red ground is somewhat more visible. This may indicate that some solvent         damage may have resulted in earlier cleanings. The full extent of abrasion         and loss cannot be ascertained before varnish and retouching reduction         or removal. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>SURFACE LAYERS </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Construction: The painting         appears to be surfaced with a synthetic resin varnish of moderate thickness.         As noted, the losses are inpainted with both synthetic and oil based mediums.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Condition: Recent solvent         testing suggests that the synthetic resin is aged and has crosslinked,         requiring fairly polar solvents for swelling and removal. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The varnish is not discolored         to an amber or yellow, rather, the varnish has a grayish tint when dissolved,         again, suggesting a synthetic resin. The varnish is now dulled and granular         in surface quality. Saturation is extremely poor, particularly in darkly         colored or toned passages. The varnish is imbedded with a substantial         dirt/grime layer. In addition, amine deposits are also probably present.         </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As noted, both the synthetic         and oil medium retouching are blanched or discolored. The oil retouching         is fairly easily thinned with acetone or other alcohols.</font></p>      <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS: </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This large painting requires         extensive conservation treatment. It is strongly recommended that the         painting be relined. The present lining should be removed and the excess         glue/paste adhesive removed from the reverse of the canvas. New lining         material would be prepared and adhered to the canvas with a thermoplastic,         stable, synthetic resin adhesive. The lined painting would be reattached         to its present stretcher.</font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Surface dirt, grime, accretions         will be removed from the surface of the painting. The synthetic resin         varnish, which appears to have crosslinked and has become insoluble in         lesser solvents, should be reduced or removed as necessary. Removal of         the varnish will become increasingly difficult as it ages and, in fact,         may be irreversible in the future. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Areas of retouching will be         reduced or removed as necessary. The painting will be varnished with an         appropriate synthetic resin to maximize saturation of the paint layers.         Losses will be filled and inpainted using stable synthetic medium. A protective         backing board will be secured to the reverse of the stretcher and the         painting will be reframed. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">TREATMENT PROPOSAL: </font></p>      <ul>        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Examination; prepare Report           on Condition and Proposal for Treatment. </font></li>        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Photodocument all phases           of treatment in color slides. </font></li>        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Remove dirt, grime, and           accretions from varnish layer. Reduce or remove aged synthetic resin           varnish; reduce discolored oil and synthetic resin medium retouching.</font></li>        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Protect paint layer with           temporary facing.
