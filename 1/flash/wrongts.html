Conservation always         begins with a thorough examination by a paintings conservator, followed         by written reports that document the painting's present condition and         make proposals for treatment. Photographs are taken before, during, and         after treatment, to visually document the painting's condition and the         progress of the project. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">2. Treatment begins         with the removal of dirt, grime, and other accretions from the varnish         layer by means of aqueous solutions. Then the discolored synthetic resin         varnish is reduced with chemicals that will not harm the original paint         layers. Finally, the distracting, discolored retouching in oil and synthetic         resins from previous restorations is reduced or removed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 3. The next step         is to replace the deteriorated lining fabric on the reverse of the painting.         But first, the newly cleaned original paint layer must be protected. A         temporary facing of tissue is attached directly to the paint layer with         an adhesive that can be easily removed later on. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">4. The painting is         removed from the wooden stretcher. The old lining fabric on the back is         then removed. Next, the old glue-paste adhesive on the reverse of the         original canvas is reduced to prepare the canvas for its new lining. Any         repairs to the canvas are made at this stage.</font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> 5. A new lining         fabric is prepared and affixed to the original canvas with a non-penetrating,         stable synthetic resin adhesive. The adhesive is activated with heated         platens expressly designed for use on large paintings. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">6. The lined painting         is reattached to the wooden stretcher, and proper tension is placed on         the canvas to prevent sagging and bulges. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">7. Attention now         returns to the cosmetic problems. The temporary facing tissue and adhesive         are removed from the paint layer, and a non-yellowing, stable synthetic         resin varnish is applied. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">8. Losses in the         paint and ground layers are filled and textured to match the surrounding         original paint layers. Losses are inpainted with a stable, non-yellowing,         non-discoloring synthetic medium. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">9. A protective backing         board is secured to the reverse of the stretcher to keep out dirt and         debris, prevent impact damage, and enhance the stretcher's structural         stability. The painting is now ready to be reframed and hung in the museum's         gallery. As the final step, the conservator writes a report detailing         all aspects of the treatment. </font></p></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
