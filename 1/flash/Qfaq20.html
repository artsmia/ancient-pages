There are two methods to become   an art conservator. The first is an extended apprenticeship, working with an   established, respected paintings conservator for a long period of time.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The second is to attend a university   art conservation graduate program. There are five graduate programs in North   America, and the individual programs accept 4 to 10 students per year. An interested   student must have a considerable amount of undergraduate credits in chemistry   and physics, art history, and studio art. The graduate programs also require   that a student have 1 to 3 years of experience in an established art conservation   laboratory. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most graduate programs are three   years in length - two years in school and a full year of an internship in a   museum, regional laboratory, or with a conservator in private practice. After   graduation, students will spend one to four years in fellowship positions, usually   in large museum conservation laboratories. Jobs in art conservation are not   plentiful and, considering the amount of education and skill that is required,   the field is not the place to become rich. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most important qualification   in paintings conservation is experience. Essential, too, is continuing education   in the field. The UMCA paintings conservators attend national and international   workshops, symposiums, congresses, and conferences. </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>  </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
