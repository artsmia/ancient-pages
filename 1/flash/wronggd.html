These ongoing         changes have necessitated restoration measures in the past, and thus the         treatment you are viewing here may be the painting's third or fourth major         conservation. Even though a painting and the materials added during conservation         age as one, the materials added to the Castiglione during old restorations         have become problematic. All of the above factors have produced condition         problems that fall into two categories, structural and cosmetic. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Structural Condition         </b><br>        The present lining fabric, attached to the reverse of the original canvas         with a water-based glue-paste, is failing to support the painting. In         large areas, the original canvas and the lining fabric have separated         because of the fabric's deterioration and the degraded adhesive. Furthermore,         there is little tension on the canvas, which is now sagging under its         own considerable weight and large bulges have developed. </font></p>      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Cosmetic Condition</b><br>        The present varnish and old retouchings detract from the painting's appearance.         The varnish--a modern synthetic resin--has discolored to a grayish tint         and has dirt embedded in it. The gloss is uneven, and the varnish does         not fully saturate the paint layers. Losses in the paint and ground layers         have been poorly filled and textured. There are at least two generations         of retouching to conceal abrasion, losses, and other disfigurements. In         the older retouching, an oil medium was applied as a flat field of color         with no attempt to reconstruct missing areas of the design. The synthetic         medium used in the more recent retouching has blanched and no longer matches         the original paint layers. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
