Over a six-week period, UMCA Paintings             Conservators Joan Gorman and David Marquis will conduct a major conservation             treatment of Castiglione's magnificent Immaculate Conception altarpiece             during public viewing hours. Acquired by the Institute in the 1960s,             this masterwork of Roman Baroque painting has been, together with             Poussin's Death of Germanicus and Rembrandt's Lucretia, one of the             cornerstones of our 17th-century European paintings collection. However,             restorations performed prior to the picture's arrival in the Twin             Cities have not aged all that gracefully and consequently detract             from the great beauty of this work. The conservation treatment to             be performed will involve relining the original linen support and             removing discolored in-painting and varnish. The working space will             include multiple viewing areas to promote maximum interaction between             the public and the conservators. A didactic presentation at the entrance             to the gallery will include information on the artist and the commission,             photographs of Castiglione's preparatory drawings and oil sketches,             and technical documentation in the form of X-ray and raking-light             photographs that relate to the treatment and its objectives. Video             recordings and a special Web site feature, both accessible in the             gallery, will allow visitors to review each stage of the treatment.<br>            </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &#150;Patrick             Noon </font></p>          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reprinted             from the ART Magazine September, 1999 Patrick Noon is the Patrick             and Aimee Butler Curator of Paintings at The Minneapolis Institute             of Arts. </font></p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>  </table></div><p align="center">&nbsp; </p><p align="left"><br></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>
