All art materials   have pros and cons. Oil paint is a beautiful medium, allowing the painter to   create effects such as glazing or working wet-into-wet. Oil paint, however,   is not appropriate for inpainting as it darkens with age and becomes difficult   to remove from an original oil paint layer. We are using dry pigments ground   in a stable synthetic medium for inpainting. The synthetic medium does not darken   or discolor with age, but it demands a good deal of skill to make a synthetic   look like a beautiful, aged oil paint. Most important, the synthetic medium   paint can be very safely removed from the painting. <br>  </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
