Surely, most paintings   conservators have worked on scores of different styles of paintings. Conserving   a painting is not repainting a work of art; rather, losses, abrasion, and damage   are very carefully inpainted. A stable, non-yellowing or non-discoloring synthetic   medium is used in thin, transparent layers and applied only to the areas of   damage. The surrounding original paint color and tonality is used to guide the   conservator during the inpainting process.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
