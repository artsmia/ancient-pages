We rarely get bored! There are   many, many procedures in paintings conservation that are tedious and repetitive.   In the laboratory at the Upper Midwest Conservation Association, we usually   have several projects under way - when one procedure becomes too trying, we   can move on to another. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes, however, a project demands   days or weeks of extremely repetitive work. During those times, a lively conversation   with a colleague or some good tunes can ease the tedium of the job. Conservators   are often thought to be a very patient lot. More accurately, we have a high   tolerance for tedious work because we know that every step, no matter how demanding,   contributes to the quality of the overall treatment. </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>  </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
