In the last 350 years, the Castiglione   has been restored two or three times, perhaps more. There are many holes and   tears in the canvas, and repairs were probably made as damage occurred. The   canvas was most probably lined in the 19th century and the present lining dates   from the middle of the 20th century. There are several campaigns of retouching   and overpaint on the painting, which indicates that more than one restoration   took place. </font></p></body></html>
