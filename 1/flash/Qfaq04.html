When cleaning   a painting, it is very important to know the difference between an original   paint layer and overpaint added to repair or disguise damage. Very often, paintings   were restored using an oil paint medium. The newer oil paint may have matched   the original layers for a period of time, but oil paint darkens slightly with   age, and soon, the restored area is easily detected. If a painting is restored   using stable, non-discoloring synthetic resin paint, the inpainting will not   darken.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">However,   the synthetic can be safely removed from an original paint layer with solvents   that will not harm the painting. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">An experienced paintings   conservator has tools at their disposal to detect restoration. Both oil and   synthetic resin overpaint or inpainting will fluoresce a different color under   an ultraviolet light source. Infrared reflectography is also helpful. Most essential   is the experienced eye of the paintings conservator. </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
