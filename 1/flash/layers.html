The modern synthetic resin  varnish has discolored with  age and the accumulation of  dirt and grime . The varnish does not fully  saturate the paint layers . At least two generations of  retouching conceal areas of  loss and damage . The oil medium used in the  older retouching and the  synthetic medium of the more  recent retouching no longer  match the original paint . .      Varnish and Refinishing  Paint Layer The paint is composed of dry  pigments ground in a linseed,  poppyseed, or walnut oil  medium to a pastelike  consistency . Primer or Ground Layer The ground isolates the paint  from the canvas so that the  oil medium does not rot the  fabric. The ground provides a  nonabsorptive surface on  which to apply paint. The ground layer on this  painting is the rich red earth  color traditional in that period  of Italian painting.  .          Primary Support A  traditional Italian open- weave linen-fiber canvas is  the primary support. Lining Fabric The painting did not originally  have a lining. The lining was added later to  support the deteriorated  canvas.  A glue-paste adhesive was  used to attach the lining to the  reverse of the original canvas. Auxiliary Support The auxiliary support is an  expandable wooden  framework over which the  lined original canvas is  stretched and secured by  tacks at the outer edges. The present stretcher is an  earlier replacement of the  painting’s original auxiliary  support. --> <div align="left"><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://active.macromedia.com/flash2/cabs/swflash.cab#version=4,0,0,0" ID=layers WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=185 vspace="0" hspace="5" border="0" align="top">    <PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="layers.swf">    <PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high>    <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#FFFFFF>    <EMBED src="layers.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFFF  WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=185 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" vspace="0" hspace="5" border="0" align="top">    </EMBED>   </OBJECT> </div></BODY></HTML>
