The standing Virgin,  fully illuminated and wearing a crown of twelve  stars, floats on clouds with a crescent moon  beneath her feet The other sections of Castiglione’s painting  reinforce themes of Mary’s purity and status.  Both figures kneeling in awe below the Virgin  wear the brown robe and cowl of the  Franciscans, and the gold rims of their halos  indicate that they are saints. These saints are  appropriate inclusions in the composition, since  the church in Osimo belonged to the Capuchin  friars, an independent and strictly observant  branch of the Franciscans Symbolism . The twelve stars represent the  twelve tribes of Israel. Examples  of this type also incorporate  features of earlier imagery of the  Virgin, drawn from verses in the  Song of Solomon in the Old  Testament. (S. of S. 6:13) describing the Shulammite  accepted as the correct  visualization of an abstract  idea, and it quickly became a  popular theme in religious  painting .  maiden as "fair as the moon and clear as the  sun … " The orange glow behind her head  represents the sun.  The fusing of Old and New  Testament imagery found in the Spanish  depiction became universally   Mary  . St. Francis of Assisi (c.1182-1226), founder of  the Franciscan Order,  appears on our left. The  cord around his waist is  distinguished by three  knots representing the  religious vows of poverty,  chastity and obedience . St. Francis can be  recognized by the stigmata on  his outstretched hands—the five marks  corresponding to Christ’s wounds—which the  saint received during a vision St. Anthony of Padua (1195 - 1231) was a friend  and disciple of St. Francis.  Among his attributes are  the lily, a standard symbol  of purity also commonly  associated with the Virgin  Mary, and a book, indicating  his great scriptural learning.      St. Anthony was well  known for his eloquent  delivery of the scripture.  His arms are crossed over  his chest in a deferential  gesture of humility The skull The skull  is a reminder of man’s  mortality, and is also an attribute  associated with St. Francis The coat of arms The coat on arms in the lower left is the crest  of the Fiorenzi family. The crest let  worshippers know that Pier Filippo Fiorenzi  paid for the painting. Considering its strange  appearance, it is likely that the crest was  added by an artist other than Castiglione. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://active.macromedia.com/flash2/cabs/swflash.cab#version=4,0,0,0" ID=symbolism WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=280 align="top">  <PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="symbolism.swf">  <PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high>  <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#FFCC99>  <EMBED src="symbolism.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFCC99  WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=280 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" align="top">  </EMBED> </OBJECT> <br><table width="480" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td>      <div align="center"><a href="#" onClick="MM_callJS('window,close();')"><img src="closewin.gif" width="86" height="31" vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="middle"></a></div>    </td>  </tr></table></BODY></HTML>
