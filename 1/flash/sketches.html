Fortunately, several of Castiglione's preliminary drawings and sketches   exist. These demonstrate the evolution of Institute's canvas' from the artist's   most cursory musings to a highly developed sketch in colored oils.<br>  </font></font></p><p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A sheet   of pen-and-ink sketches (fig. 1) explores several themes (Coronation of the   Virgin, baptism) positioned around a Virgin with arms outstretched, standing   on a crescent moon. In another sketch (fig. 2), Castiglione worked on the spatial   relationship between the Virgin and one of the saints in the foreground. </font></font></p><p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About   the same time he made the Institute's altarpiece, Castiglione created other   paintings of saints in attitudes of prayer, adoration, or ecstasy. Comparing   those figures to the preparatory sketches indicates Castiglione was not averse   to reusing images or adapting them to the requirements of another composition.   The figure studies most closely related to the Institute's altarpiece (figs.   3, 4, 5) display the vitality and free handling typical of Castiglione's work   at this time, and their degree of finish suggests they are preparatory models   for a larger work. </font></font></p><p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comparing   the highly developed oil sketch (fig. 6) with the Institute's altarpiece reveals   how the artist finally resolved the composition. Most obvious is his full treatment   of the angel choir flanking the Virgin. More subtle is the omission of the putti   who, in the drawing, hold Saint Anthony's book. This simplifies the composition,   thereby adding emphasis to the figure of the enraptured saint. <br>  </font></font></p></body></html>
