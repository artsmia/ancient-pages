Painting strongly lit foreground           figures against a dark background, as he has done in the Holy Family,           was a device invented by Caravaggio and adopted by many other artists.           </font> </div>        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like           Caravaggio, Trist&agrave;n did not distort or idealize his subjects;           rather, he insisted on portraying what was real and believable. The           figures in this work look like people who might be encountered in daily           life. And the precisely rendered still-life elements (Oriental rug,           basket, handkerchief) also contribute to the realistic effect.The Child           looks toward us, smiling, and seems to draw us into the world of the           picture. </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Depictions           of the Virgin nursing the Christ Child were unusual at this period,           having lost favor after 1563, when the Council of Trent prohibited undue           nudity in representations of the saints and Holy Family . <br>          </font></p>        <p align="left"><br>        </p>        <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>          </font></p>        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>          </font></p>        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        </div>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font color="#000000"> </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
