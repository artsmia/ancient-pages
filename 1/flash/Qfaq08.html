Tears in a canvas   are extremely difficult to repair. Once ripped, torn, or punctured, a canvas   curls and distorts. Tears are mended using one of a variety of techniques, but   it is not easy to predict how a particular canvas support will react to treatment.   Once repaired, a tear is filled and textured to imitate the original canvas   or paint texture.
