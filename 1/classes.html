      <p><b>Transforming the Body: Photography and the Nude</b></p>
      <p> Part personal expression, part artistic invention, part social comment, 
        and endlessly suspended between the erotic and the aesthetic, the nude 
        has always been photography&#146;s least understood genre. Expanding on 
        the exhibition &quot;<a href="exhibits/body_description.html">Body Work: 
        Photographs of Nudes</a>,&quot; this class will examine the ways photographers 
        have transformed the bodies in front of their cameras into powerful visual 
        statements. In addition, participants will trace the relationship between 
        the photographic nude and changing social conventions. Instructor: Vince
