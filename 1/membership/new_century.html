The amount need not be revealed, but if you choose to do so it         will aid our long-range planning. It will also allow us to acknowledge         your gift at its present value and credit you appropriately.       <p><a href="joining_new_century.html">A membership form is available online.</a>       <h3><br>        Benefits of Membership </h3>      <ul type=disc>        <li>Lifetime recognition in the Institute's annual report         <li>Recognition in the museum's lobby         <li>Invitations to special Institute events         <li>The knowledge that you are helping to secure the future of the arts           in our community         <li>Additional charitable and estate planning services       </ul>      <p>&nbsp;       <p><b>For More Information</b>       <p>If want more information or have questions about the New Century Society         or the MIA's Charitable and Estate Planning Services, please call:       <blockquote>         <p>Richard Meyer<br>          Director, Endowments and Planned Giving<br>          (612) 870-3023. </p>      </blockquote>      <hr>      <i><a href="/comments">Send us your comments</a> </i>       <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr></table><P>&nbsp;
