Several recent studies have shown that consumers           understand and appreciate sponsorship&#151;and that sponsorship can           greatly influence buying decisions. In fact, sponsorship has the greatest           impact on highly educated, higher income individuals who are difficult           to reach through traditional media.

In an environment where the medium is the message,           a sponsorship relationship with The Minneapolis Institute of Arts represents           an invaluable association with quality&#151;and a promotional platform           for reaching an upscale audience of nearly 600,000 per year. </p>      </blockquote>      <h3> <br>        Picture your company forging a direct link with a large and loyal audience       </h3>      <blockquote>         <p>What's more, this large audience clearly understands and appreciates           the companies that support the Institute's many outstanding programs.           In a 1995 survey, 95% of Institute visitors had a positive image of           a business that sponsors programs at the museum, and 39% said they would           be more likely to purchase the products or services of a business participating           in an Institute sponsorship. </p>      </blockquote>      <h3><br>        Picture your company achieving multiple goals from a custom-designed sponsorship         program </h3>      <blockquote>         <p>Corporate sponsorships at the Institute are specially tailored to the           needs and nature of each sponsor's business. Past sponsors have leveraged           their association to achieve employee-relations objectives, to entertain           important clients, or to reward staff performance. All sponsorships           include prominent recognition in the museum and in promotional materials,           cross-promotional opportunities and options for corporate entertainment.         </p>      </blockquote>      <p>&nbsp;       <p><b>For more information contact: </b>       <blockquote>         <p>Joan Grathwol Olson<br>          Director of Corporate and Foundation Support<br>          (612) 870-3266<br>          <a href="mailto:joloson@artsMIA.org">jolson@artsMIA.org </a></p>      </blockquote>      <hr>      <i><a href="/comments">Send us your comments</a> </i>       <blockquote>         <p>&nbsp;</p>      </blockquote>    </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</body></html>
