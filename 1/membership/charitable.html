Throughout its history, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts         has benefited from the generosity of thousands of individuals and families.         Today, voluntary contributions are increasingly important as we work to         become more accessible and responsive to the evolving cultural and educational         needs of our community. Although annual gifts continue to be the foundation         on which we build, there are many other ways in which donors support the         museum:       <ul type=disc>        <li>           <p>Gifts to Named Endowed Funds for Programs, Lectures, Art Acquisitions             and Scholarships         <li>Gifts of Art         <li>Gifts of Cash or Securities         <li>Gifts of Real Estate or Valuables         <li>Gifts of Life Insurance         <li>Gift of a Home or Farm         <li>Gifts through Your Will       </ul>      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>      <h3>Taking the First Steps </h3>      <p>Friends of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts often ask how to begin considering         whether a life income or other form of planned gift is appropriate for         them.
