      <h2> Opportunities and Events for Members </h2>
      <p><b>Arts Circle</b> </p>
      <p> A committee is beginning preparations for a Masquerade Ball in the halls 
        of the museum in November 2001. Masquerade Ball chair Terry Benson is 
        actively recruiting members to help with the planning. &quot;It is a big 
        step for Arts Circle, and a wonderful way to showcase the museum&quot; 
        said Benson. Anyone interested in joining Arts Circle or helping work 
        on the Masquerade Ball should call the Members&#146; Hotline at 612-870-6323.</p>
