He wanted to marry Danae, but         wanted nothing to do with her adult son, Perseus. Hoping to         get rid of Perseus, Polydectes ruthlessly tricked the young         man into brashly undertaking a deadly mission - to bring him         the head of a dreaded monster called Medusa.</P>                  <P>Medusa was one of three fearsome Gorgon sisters who lived         far away in a secret hiding place. The sisters had brass         claws, golden wings, boars' tusks, and masses of hissing         snakes for hair. Anyone who looked into their frightful         faces instantly turned into stone.</P>                  <P>Fortunately, the gods Athena (a-THEE-na) and Hermes         (HER-meez), and three nymphs offered to help Perseus. Athena         gave him a shiny bronze shield and Hermes gave him a sword         that could not be bent by the Gorgons' scales. The nymphs         gave Perseus winged shoes so that he could fly, a cap that         made him invisible, and a pouch in which to carry the         Gorgon's head.</P>                  <P>Perseus flew first to the home of the aged ones. These         three women, who were sisters to the Gorgons, were born with         gray hair and shared a single eye and tooth between them.         Wearing his cap of invisibility, Perseus snatched the eye as         one sister passed it to another. Threatening to keep the         eye, Perseus coerced them into revealing the Gorgon's secret         hiding place.</P>                  <P>Perseus arrived at the cave of the Gorgons, where, by         good fortune, they were all asleep. In order to see Medusa         without turning to stone, Perseus located her grotesque face         in a reflection on his shiny shield. He swiftly cut off her         head, dropped it into his bag, and fled from Medusa's angry         sisters. When Perseus returned to Seriphos, the evil         Polydectes laughed at him and asked what was in his sack.         Perseus pulled out the horrifying head of Medusa and turned         Polydectes to stone.</P>                  <P>You see, Medusa's severed head retained its power to turn         people into stone, so Perseus carried it on many adventures,         using it to defeat his enemies. Eventually, in gratitude for         her protection, Perseus gave Medusa's head to Athena, who         placed it on her breastplate to ward off evil.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Medusa</B><BR>                  Perseus's story is one of many Greek monster-slayer myths         that features the theme of good outwitting evil. Since at         least the 6th century B.C., Greeks placed images of Medusa's         terrifying head on shields and buildings in order to         frighten away enemies and evil spirits.</P>                  <P>According to 4th-century B.C. revisions of her story,         Medusa was a beautiful woman who was turned into a monster         by jealous Athena. At the turn of the 19th to the 20th         century, writers and artists popularized the image of Medusa         as a beautiful young woman.</P>                  <P><B>French Sculpture</B><BR>                  No single style dominated French sculpture at the turn of         the century. Sculptors worked in         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>,         expressionistic, and         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A> symbolic         styles. In response to the popular appeal of the consciously         decorative Art Nouveau style, many artists incorporated its         organic forms and long, sinuous curves into their art.</P>                  <P><B>Emile-Antoine Bourdelle</B><BR>                  Emile-Antoine Bourdelle (ay-MEEL an-TWAN boor-DELL) was an         eclectic sculptor who drew upon a number of the diverse         trends of his time, including elements of Art Nouveau. He         drew most heavily upon the organic qualities of French         Romanesque and Gothic cathedral sculpture and the simple         forms of archaic Greek sculpture. Motivated by his         conviction that history's greatest sculptures were those         integrated with architecture, Bourdelle created many of his         sculptures for architectural settings.</P>                  <P><B>Door Knocker in Form of Medusa</B><BR>                  In this bronze door knocker, Bourdelle depicts the severed         head of Medusa, hanging from Perseus's clenched fist. Above         his hand a bunch of snakes writhe, striking out as if they         are going to attack. Below, only a few of Medusa's many         braids actually look like scaly snakes.</P>                  <P>As was popular at the turn of the century, Bourdelle         represents Medusa as a beautiful young woman rather than the         horrible monster of the original story. Her facial features         - high cheekbones, narrow nose, square chin, and the corners         of her small mouth - consciously recall the expressively         modeled faces of archaic Greek sculptures of young women.         The dominant curves of her hair, however, reflect the         popular Art Nouveau style.</P>                  <P>Bourdelle's clever transformation of Medusa into an         ornamental door knocker attests to his commitment to         integrating sculpture and architecture. Two entwined braids         extend from ear to ear to create the knocker's handle. When         lifted back and forth, Medusa's head would knock against the         circular form behind it. Bourdelle produced ten casts of         this door knocker, an indication that he designed it for a         general market rather than for a specific door.         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Perseus and Medusa. </B>         Where do you see Perseus in this bronze sculpture? <B>(The         hand holding the head of Medusa is Perseus's hand.) </B>         Where do you see snakes? <B>(Medusa's hair, above Perseus's         hand.)</B> According to the story, what would happen if you         saw this scene in real life? <B>(You would turn to         stone!)</B></P>                  <P><B>2.</B> This bronze sculpture had a special purpose.         Can you tell what it was used for? <B>(A door knocker.)</B>         Where is the handle? <B>(Two braids extending from Medusa's         ears loop down under her head to form the handle.) </B> What         part of this sculpture is the knocker? <B> (Medusa's head         knocks against the circle behind it.)</B> How can you tell?         <B>(The handle is attached to the head.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> According to the story of Perseus and Medusa,         Medusa was so grotesquely ugly that anyone who looked at her         would turn to stone. Do you think the face of Medusa in         Bourdelle's sculpture is ugly? Explain. <B>Discuss the         4th-century B.C. revisions of the story that cast Medusa as         a beautiful young woman. Bourdelle's sculpture of Medusa's         face recalls archaic Greek sculpture.</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> When Bourdelle made this door knocker, Art         Nouveau was a popular         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A>. Sculpture created         in the Art Nouveau style is characterized by long elegant         curves.

Bourdelle made Medusa's head into a door         knocker. Why do you think Medusa was a popular image for         buildings? <B>Recall how Perseus and then Athena used         Medusa's head to protect them from their enemies.</B>         <B>(Medusa provided protection for the inhabitants of         buildings, much as she provided protection for Perseus and         Athena.)</B> Athena appears on the         <A HREF="slide7.html">Greek hydria in image 7</A>.

Describe the kind of door you might hang it on.         A bathroom door? A broom closet door? Why or why not? How         big would a door have to be to accommodate this door         knocker? <B>(Very large - even the front door of an average         family home would be too small to accommodate it.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Bourdelle believed that history's greatest         sculptures were those integrated with architecture. His         transformation of Medusa into an ornamental door knocker         illustrates his conviction. Where have you seen examples of         sculpture integrated with architecture in your neighborhood?         In places you have visited? Describe them.</P>                  <P><B>4.</B> The story of Perseus and Medusa is one of many         Greek monster-slayer myths celebrating the victory of good         over evil. Can you think of any stories popular today in         which an evil monster is conquered? <B>(Batman, the         Ghostbusters, and Alien movies, Rumpelstiltskin, Dracula,         Frankenstein.)</B><BR>                           <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER="3">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html#top">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable Resources</A>         ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~         <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html#top">Your Comments Wanted</A>         ~ <A HREF="#Story">Story</A> ~         <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~         <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
