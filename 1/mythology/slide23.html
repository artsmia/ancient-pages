His first wife         bore a thousand children who all decided to become monks and         follow the Buddha's law. His second wife had only two sons.         The youngest was named Non-o (NON-oh) and helped his monk         brothers with their worship. The eldest, Kongorikishi,         however, had a much more aggressive personality. He vowed to         protect the Buddha and his worshipers by fighting against         evil and ignorance.         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Nio </B><BR>                  Kongorikishi was the first of the heavenly kings, called         Nio. The Nio were originally Hindu gods in India, who were         adopted by the Japanese into the Buddhist pantheon. The Nio,         also called Kongo, all came to be considered aggressive         guardian deities in the tradition of Kongorikishi. Within         the generally pacifist traditions of Buddhism, stories of         Nio guardians like Kongorikishi justified the use of         physical force to protect cherished values and beliefs         against evil.</P>                  <P><B>Samurai </B><BR>                  Widespread discontent with the dictatorship of the Taira         (tie-RAH) clan in Kyoto (key-OH-toe) caused an enormous         uprising in 1180. Five years of brutal civil war ensued,         ending when the Minamoto clan overthrew the Taira. The         Minamoto handed control of the new government to a group of         loyal warriors, called samurai (SAM-oo-rye). The samurai         unified their forces under a code known as the "way of the         warrior" which valued bravery, honor, and strength.</P>                  <P>In art, the luxurious tastes and refinement of the Kyoto         nobility were replaced by the directness and simplicity of         the samurai. The dynamic spirit of the age demanded art that         was similarly big and brash. The civil war had severely         damaged many temples, and artists set about rebuilding,         restoring, and replacing lost sculptures. In many instances         they emulated the <A HREF="glossary.html#IDEALIZED">         IDEALIZED</A> but <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">         NATURALISTIC</A> art made hundreds of years earlier during         the Nara period (645-784). Among the many sculptures         produced were pairs of large Nio guardian figures that stood         outside Buddhist temple complexes.</P>                  <P><B>Nio Guardian Figures </B><BR>                  These Nio guardian figures named Misshaku (mish-AH-koo)         Kongo (congo)-with his fist raised-and Naeren (NAY-ren)         Kongo (congo) represent the use of overt power and latent         power, respectively. They display the energy and realism         characteristic of late 14th-century Japanese sculpture.</P>                  <P>Standing on banks of fluffy clouds, the guardians are         enormously muscled half-nude figures. Their features have         been skillfully exaggerated by an artist well versed in the         human form. Bulging muscles in their huge chests and arms         communicate power even at a great distance. This exaggerated         <A HREF="glossary.html#REALISM"> REALISM</A> continues in         the Nios' popping veins, extended jaws, and even in their         delicate fingernails and toenails. The guardians' hair,         pulled tightly into topknots, adds to their imposing height.         </P>                  <P>For all of their power, the Nio are also decorative.         Their flower-shaped nipples and rippled rib cages form an         elegant <A HREF="glossary.html"> PATTERN</A>. The         dark and light areas on the sculptures are traces of         <A HREF="glossary.html#GESSO">GESSO</A> and black         <A HREF="glossary.html#LACQUER"> LACQUER</A> that once         covered their surfaces. Flesh-colored pigments covered         portions of the lacquer.</P>                  <P>The Nio exhibit tremendous energy. Their arms, legs, and         clublike feet dramatically jut into space, and drapery         swirls violently around them. The Nio's bulging eyes,         furrowed brows, flaring nostrils, and distorted grimaces         bring their faces to life.</P>                  <P>Conceived as a pair, the Nio complement each other.         Misshaku Kongo, representing overt power, bares his teeth         and raises his fist in action, while Naeren Kongo,         representing latent might, holds his mouth tightly closed         and waits with both arms tensed but lowered.</P>                  <P>Each Nio figure represents a particular cosmic sound.         Misshaku Kongo's open mouth sounds out "ah," meaning birth.         Naeren Kongo sounds "om," meaning death. Thus, in one cosmic         sound life is encapsulated at a temple doorway, reminding         viewers that life is fleeting and that good karma is         necessary to avoid rebirth on the Wheel of Life.         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>LOOK</B><BR>                  <B>1. </B> <B>Tell the story of Kongorikishi. </B>This story         justified the use of physical force to defend the Buddha and         his worshippers against evil. How do these guardian figures,         part of the tradition of Kongorikishi, personify physical         force? Consider: size, musculature, body type, and pose.         <B>These figures are over six feet tall, bulging muscles and         stocky build suggest strength, poses suggest energetic         movement.</B></P>                  <P><B>2.</B> What are these figures standing on?         <B>Clouds.</B> How can you tell? <B>Bases are carved in         swirling mist-like patterns. </B> What does that tell us         about their domain? <B>Heavenly domain rather than         earthly.</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Compare these two guardian figures. What is the         same about them? <B> Height, weight, musculature and body         type, body decoration and jewelry, hairstyle, facial         features, garments. </B>What is different? <B> Poses or         gestures, facial expressions.</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> One of the figures stands for latent power and         the other stands for direct action. Which is which? How can         you tell? <B>The figure with its fist raised, Misshaku         Kongo, stands for direct action. Raised fist, stiff right         arm and open mouth with bared teeth suggest that this figure         is physically threatening. Explain that Misshaku Kongo's         mouth sounds out "ah", meaning birth. The figure with its         arms lowered, Naeren Kongo, stands for latent power. Lowered         bent arms close to the body and hand extended in a halting         gesture, mouth closed, suggest that this figure's power is         contained, in control. Explain that Naeren Kongo's mouth         sounds out "om", meaning death.</B></P>                  <P><B>5.</B> These Nio Guardian figures would have stood         outside the entrance to a Buddhist temple. Look carefully at         these figures standing side by side. Is one made for the         left side of an entrance and one made for the right? Which         is which? How can you tell? <B>Misshaku Kong, with raised         fist, was meant for the left side and Naeren Kongo, with         arms lowered, was meant for the right. In this         configuration, Naeren Kongo's lowered arm fits neatly under         Misshaku Kongo's raised fist, their extended legs are mirror         images of each other, they face away from each other rather         than toward each other and their garments flow outward, away         from the entrance that would have been between them.</B>         </P>                  <P><B>6.</B> In art, NATURALISTIC means representing         something the way you would see it in nature. STYLIZED means         representing something by distorting its natural forms to         express an idea about it. Where has the artist who carved         these figures used naturalistic representation?         <B>Musculature on arms, abdomen, facial expression, drapery         on clothing.</B> Where has he used stylized representation?         <B>Hair, ears, chest and rib cage, nipples, hands,         feet.</B><BR>                           <HR>         <BR>                  <B>THINK</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> These wooden Nio Guardian figures were originally         covered with black lacquer. Some traces of the lacquer still         appear on the sculptures. Would they be more or less         threatening if they still had their black coating? Explain.         <B>No right answer.</B></P>                  <P><B>2.</B> Nio Guardian figures served as symbolic         protection at a Buddhist temple hundreds of years ago. What         are symbols of protection that we see today? <B>Operation         Identification stickers on front doors, McGruff safe house         signs, bars on windows, traffic signs serve as protection         for drivers.</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> These two guardian figures stood outside an         entrance to a Buddhist temple. Buddhism is a nonviolent         religion. What message would these sculptures convey to the         Buddhist worshippers who pass between them? <B> Recall the         story of Kongorikishi. Rather than intimidate Buddhist         worshippers the Nio Guardian figures were meant to reassure         them that they were protected against evil forces.</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> Each Nio figure represents a particular cosmic         sound. Misshaku Kongo's open mouth sounds out "ah", meaning         birth. Naeren Kongo's mouth sounds out "om", meaning death.         What purpose might these sounds serve at a Buddhist temple         entrance? They encompass life, reminding worshippers that         their spiritual life is contained in the temple.</P>                  <P>         <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER="3">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html#top">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable Resources</A>         ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~         <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html#top">Your Comments Wanted</A>         ~ <A HREF="slide23.html">Story</A> ~         <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~         <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
