But the people         of that world did not behave themselves. Displeased, the         Creating Power set out to make a new world. He sang several         songs to bring rain, which poured stronger with each song.         As he sang the fourth song, the earth split apart and water         gushed up through the many cracks, causing a flood. By the         time the rain stopped, all of the people and nearly all of         the animals had drowned. Only Kangi the crow survived.</P>                  <P>Kangi pleaded with the Creating Power to make him a new         place to rest. So the Creating Power decided the time had         come to make his new world. From his huge pipe bag, which         contained all types of animals and birds, the Creating Power         selected four animals known for their ability to remain         under water for a long time. He sent each in turn to         retrieve a lump of mud from beneath the floodwaters. First         the loon dove deep into the dark waters, but it was unable         to reach the bottom. The otter, even with its strong webbed         feet, also failed. Next, the beaver used its large flat tail         to propel itself deep under the water, but it too brought         nothing back. Finally, the Creating Power took the turtle         from his pipe bag and urged it to bring back some mud.</P>                  <P>Turtle stayed under the water for so long that everyone         was sure it had drowned. Then, with a splash, the turtle         broke the water's surface! Mud filled its feet and claws and         the cracks between its upper and lower shells. Singing, the         Creating Power shaped the mud in his hands and spread it on         the water, where it was just big enough for himself and the         crow. He then shook two long eagle wing feathers over the         mud until earth spread wide and varied, overcoming the         waters. Feeling sadness for the dry land, the Creating Power         cried tears that became oceans, streams, and lakes. He named         the new land Turtle Continent in honor of the turtle who         provided the mud from which it was formed.</P>                  <P>The Creating Power then took many animals and birds from         his great pipe bag and spread them across the earth. From         red, white, black, and yellow earth, he made men and women.         The Creating Power gave the people his sacred pipe and told         them to live by it. He warned them about the fate of the         people who came before them. He promised all would be well         if all living things learned to live in harmony. But the         world would be destroyed again if they made it bad and ugly.         </P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P>The Lakota were once part of a much larger group of         people, the Dakota, who lived in the northern woodlands,         including the southern two-thirds of Minnesota. Within the         Dakota were three closely related language groups - the         Dakota-speakers, the Nakota-speakers, and the         Lakota-speakers. All shared a sedentary life-style, living         in bark lodges in the forests, harvesting wild rice, and         making maple sugar. Invasions by the French in the 1640s and         ensuing battles with their own Indian enemies forced many         Nakota and Lakota to move westward. They developed         distinctive Plains cultures. The Lakota acquired horses,         introduced to North America by the Spanish in the 17th         century, and by the 18th century were nomadic buffalo         hunters.</P>                  <P>By the mid-19th century, Euro-American settlers had         overrun the sacred lands of the Lakota, and white hunters         had decimated the buffalo herds on which the Plains Indians         depended. Eventually the United States government confined         the Plains Indians to designated lands called reservations.         Although reservations deprived them of their traditional way         of life, the Lakota struggled to preserve many of their         cultural traditions.</P>                  <P><B>Quilling and Beading</B><BR>                  <A HREF="glossary.html#QUILLWORK">QUILLWORK</A> was the         primary art form of traditional Lakota women. They decorated         clothing and other surfaces with         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> designs         elaborately embroidered with dyed porcupine or bird quills.         When colorful glass beads became readily available from         Euro-American traders, they began to replace quills in         embroidered ornamentation. Beads were easier to acquire,         easier to use, and came in a wide variety of bright colors.         Beadworkers strung several beads onto a thread and then         stitched them down at intervals to create colorful and often         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLIC</A> patterns. The         forced immobility and economic hardships of reservation life         spurred a golden age in Lakota beadwork, especially as         beaded objects became valued items in the tourist market.         </P>                  <P><B>Turtle</B><BR>                  Lakota dance dresses are traditionally decorated with a         beaded yoke that incorporates the         turtle-by-the-shore-of-the-lake design. Because of her role         in the creation story of the Lakota, the turtle is a sacred         animal. The Lakota associate women with the sacred turtle         because of their gif t of creating human life. Lakota women         aspired to be like the turtle - resilient and long-lived.         Turtle <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</A> (moe-TEEFS)         were beaded on women's dresses, leggings, and bags and on         cradle boards and protective umbilical amulets for baby         girls.</P>                  <P><B>Woman's Dress</B><BR>                  This was the "best dress" of a Lakota woman, worn for         dancing or for special occasions. When a woman danced in         this dress, the beaded yoke sparkled in the sunlight, the         fringe swung up and down, and the bells jingled.</P>                  <P>The beaded designs on the yoke have spiritual power and         significance. At the lower center of the yoke, resting         directly over the wearer's heart, is a multicolored U-shaped         design representing the sacred turtle. The narrow white         strip across the width of the yoke is the lakeshore. The         blue-and-gold design in the white strip above the turtle may         represent a morning star, and the checkered designs around         it may suggest mountains or hills. Above the white strip,         the broad blue area punctuated by         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMMETRY">SYMMETRICAL</A> designs         represents the sky's reflection in the waters of the lake,         the home of the sacred turtle. While the meaning of most of         these designs is no longer known, designs in this part of a         Lakota dress traditionally referred to spiritual beings who         lived in the sky and on the lakeshore. By the early 20th         century, when this dress was made, Lakota artists often used         such designs for aesthetic or visual effect alone.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the Lakota story of the remaking of the         world.

If we were to see it as it was meant to be used, we         would hear music, the beads would reflect the light, the         bells would jingle, and the fringe would swing and sway with         the dancer's movements. Is it possible for us to appreciate         this dress as a work of art even though we cannot see it         being worn in a dance? Why or why not? Would we appreciate         the dress more if we could see the dress on a dancer? Why or         why not? <B>(No right answer.)</B><BR>                           <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER="3">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html#top">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable Resources</A>         ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~         <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html#top">Your Comments Wanted</A>         ~ <A HREF="#Story">Story</A> ~         <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~         <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
