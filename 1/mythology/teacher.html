Mythology often addresses the theme of good conquering         evil. How is this theme addressed in the stories in this         collection of images? Who or what represents good in these         stories? Who or what represents evil? Which works of art         focus on this conflict? How?</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>2. All the works of art in this collection of images were         inspired by mythology. What else do they have in common? How         are they different? Use the         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> chart         to select works of art for comparison. You might choose two         works of art from the category of         <A HREF="heromyths.html#top">Hero Myths</A>, for example,         and compare them in terms of media and technique, function,         size, cultural origins, narrative, style, expressive         quality, subject matter, or artistic intent.</P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B>Brainteaser:</B> Do these works of art illustrate         myths?

If you would like to reserve a docent-led         tour, please call the Tour Office at (612) 870-3140 at least         one month in advance.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>When you schedule a docent-led tour, your docent will         contact you before your tour date. Since it is not possible         for the museum to keep all works of art on view at all         times, we recommend that you plan to discuss your particular         interests with your docent when she or he calls. Because         April and May are the museum's busiest months, we encourage         you to schedule tours at other times of the year.</P>                  <P>Now, if you're ready, begin exploring World Mythology         with the <A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>.         <!--------Bottom Myth Menu------></P>                  <P>         <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE> </CENTER> <TABLE BORDER="3">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html#top">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable Resources</A>         ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to         Order</A> ~ <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html#top">Your Comments         Wanted</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
