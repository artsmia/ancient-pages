Down         this chain climbed Oduduwa, Olorun's son. Oduduwa brought         with him a handful of dirt, a special five-toed chicken, and         a palm nut. He threw the dirt upon the ancient waters and         set the chicken on the dirt. The chicken busily scratched         and scattered the dirt until it formed the first dry earth.         In the center of this new world, Oduduwa created the         magnificent Ife (EE-fay) kingdom. He planted the palm nut,         which grew into a proud tree with 16 branches, symbolizing         the 16 sons and grandsons of Oduduwa.<BR>                  <BR>                  Oduduwa was the first ruler of the kingdom and the father of         all Yoruba. Over time he crowned his 16 sons and grandsons         and sent them off to establish their own great Yoruba         kingdoms. As descendants of the sky god, these first Yoruba         rulers and their direct descendants were divine kings. Only         they could wear special veiled crowns that symbolized their         sacred power.<BR>                           <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>The Yoruba</B><BR>                  The Yoruba peoples of West Africa have lived in the         southwestern area of what are now Nigeria and the Republic         of Benin (BE-neen) since the 11th century. The earliest         Yoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo (oh-YO) spread over vast         territories. Divine kings, descendants of Oduduwa, ruled         these kingdoms, advised by councils of elders and chiefs. As         part of their royal         <A HREF="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</A>, kings wore         distinctive beaded veiled crowns.</P>                  <P><B>Crowns</B><BR>                  The beaded veiled crown, called <I>adenla</I> ("great         crown"), is more than a symbol of kingship. Each crown         embodies ideals of political and personal stability, refuge         for the oppressed, salvation, and much more. Worn only on         ceremonial occasions, the crown gave the king the power to         communicate with his spirit ancestors in order to benefit         his people. At other times it was kept on display and given         the same respect and attention as the king himself. Because         these crowns hold so much power, they are among the most         sacred Yoruba objects.</P>                  <P>Beginning in the 1830s, civil wars disrupted the Yoruba         kingdoms. From the 1890s until the 1960s, British and French         interference further challenged traditional Yoruba ways. In         this climate of political upheaval, Yoruba leaders without         official claims to kingship began to commission and wear         veiled crowns. Although the sacred powers of Yoruba kings         are limited today, disputes still rage over the rights to         wear veiled crowns.</P>                  <P><B>King's Crown</B><BR>                  This 19th-century king's crown is made of thousands of tiny         brightly colored glass beads. Many features of this crown         are characteristic of nearly all sacred Yoruba crowns.</P>                  <P><B>Veil</B><BR>                  The most distinctive feature of this crown is the veil of         beads that once cascaded over the king's face. A net of         black, white, maroon, and blue beads is surrounded by         multicolored strands of beads. The veil obscured the king's         features to protect men and women from looking directly at         his face when he was united with his powerful ancestors.         </P>                  <P><B>Face</B><BR>                  A great yellow face dominates the crown. Its black-and-white         almond-shaped eyes, yellow nose, and oval blue mouth are         raised from the surface. The three vertical lines on either         side of the nose are scars denoting the king's lineage. The         face represents a royal ancestor of the king, probably         Oduduwa, and unites the spirit world of the ancestors with         the earthly world of the king and his people.</P>                  <P><B>Projection</B><BR>                  A tall striped projection, perhaps representing a hairstyle,         stands above the face. Among some Yoruba, projections from         the heads of special individuals signify spiritual power.         The projection on this crown once contained a pouch of         herbal medicines that gave the crown its power. For fear he         would be blinded, even the king could not look inside his         own crown.</P>                  <P><B>Birds</B><BR>                  Sixteen colorful beaded birds surround the king's crown.         These birds signify a divine force called <I>&agrave;she</I>         (ah-SHE)--the power to make things happen--which only the         highest Yoruba men and women possess. The birds connote the         &agrave;she of the king and of a group of elderly women         called "the mothers" who support him. The mothers' special         power enables them to turn into night birds who punish or         destroy those who are arrogant, selfish, or otherwise         immoral. On the crown, the birds symbolize the king's power         and the mothers' power to protect him and the people.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell or read the story of Oduduwa</B>.
