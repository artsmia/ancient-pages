Out of Chaos came Night         and Erebus (AIR-a-bus), a dim place. All was still, black,         silent, and without end until Love emerged. Love brought         Light and Day, which then produced Earth. No one can recall         just how any of this happened. Then Earth, called Gaea         (JEE-ah), produced the boundless blue Heaven, called Uranus         (YUR-a-nus). The union of Heaven and Earth produced gigantic         monstrous children with overwhelming power. Among their         children were the one-eyed Cyclops (SIGH-clops), the         100-handed Hecatoncheires (hec-a-TAHN-churs), and the mighty         natural forces, the Titans.</P>                  <P>Six female and six male Titans ruled the universe. One of         them was called Oceanus because he ruled the great river         Ocean that encircled the earth and formed its outermost         limits. Oceanus and his Titan wife, Tethys (TEH-thees), had         3,000 sons and 3,000 daughters. Their sons were the spirits         of the rivers. Their daughters, known as Oceanids, were         spirits of streams and springs. Eventually, the Titans'         children destroyed their parents and became the gods of the         Greek world.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Creation Myth</B><BR>                  Greek creation myths, and their Roman counterparts,         explained the origin, structure, and nature of the world.         These mythologies were central to ancient religions, though         as time passed they came to be viewed as literature more         than anything. Hesiod (HES-ee-ud), the Greek poet-historian,         wrote the most detailed account of the Greeks' creation         mythology. He presented creation in the form of a         genealogical chart. According to Hesiod, the six Titan         couples produced the first generation of Greek deities.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>The ancient Romans adapted much of the Greeks' mythology,         including their notion of creation. In many cases, Roman         household gods, practical forces in daily life, took on the         fabulous personalities and exciting exploits of the Greek         gods.</P>                  <P><B>Roman Empire</B><BR>                  The Roman Empire was born in 31 B.C. when Octavian Caesar,         later known as Augustus, triumphed after 90 years of civil         war. Augustus and his immediate successors in the 1st         century A.D. promoted the arts in order to display the         grandeur of their empire.</P>                  <P><B>Realism</B><BR>                  The general, idealized figures of ancient Greek sculpture,         frequently emulated by early Romans, gave way to realistic         portraiture in the 1st century A.D. The Romans, who valued         the family, recorded the faces and character traits of         important family members in realistic portraits.         Individualistic details such as wrinkled foreheads,         prominent noses, or slacking jowls were marks of hard work         and accomplishment. Artists portrayed gods and other         mythical beings with similar         <A HREF="glossary.html#REALISM">REALISM</A> and         individuality.</P>                  <P><B>Furnishings</B><BR>                  Affluent Romans liked to display their wealth in elaborately         decorated furnishings. Ornamental pieces, called bosses,         adorned the juncture points of tables, stools, and the         curving heads and footboards of luxurious bronze and wooden         couches. The finest pieces incorporated detailed         <A HREF="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAY</A> work in silver,         ivory, and tortoiseshell.<BR>                  <BR>                  <B>Oceanus</B><BR>                  This circular bronze boss depicts the Titan Oceanus. His         bearded face projects out from a         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A> of         decorative scales. In keeping with the artistic realism of         the time, Oceanus is portrayed as a bearded old man, not as         a monster or a sublime force of nature. Locks of wavy hair         frame his heavy face. His eyes are inlaid silver, and silver         and copper inlays highlight his cheeks, nose, and forehead.         Two dolphins leap from the top of his head, suggesting the         form of a crown and alluding to Oceanus's role as an aquatic         ruler. Two fish dive among the locks of his hair near his         temples, and two others emerge from his beard.</UL>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Oceanus.</B> What did Oceanus         rule over as a Titan? <B>(The ocean.)</B> Can you see         evidence of his role as ruler of the ocean in this bronze?         <B>(Head emerges out of a "scaly"         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>.
