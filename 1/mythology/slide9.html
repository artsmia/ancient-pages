His failed attempt to            drive his father's chariot across the sky is a warning to            those who are too ambitious.                        <LI>Italian RENAISSANCE scholars were fascinated with the            <A HREF="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A> past of            the ancient Greeks and Romans. They gave Christian            meanings to classical myths, including the story of            Phaeton.                        <LI>The Italian Renaissance            <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A> is evident in the            classical <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIFS</A>            (moe-TEEFS) and the            <A HREF="glossary.html#REALISM">REALISM</A> of the carved            panels on this storage chest, called a <I>cassone</I>            (cass-OH-nay).         </UL>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Story"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Story</B></CENTER></P>                  <P>Phaeton journeyed east to the sun god's grand royal         palace. Helios welcomed his son and, to prove their bond,         promised young Phaeton any favor he wished. He did not         anticipate that the headstrong boy would ask for permission         to drive his powerful chariot by himself for a day. Bound by         his promise, Helios had to give in. Just before daybreak         Phaeton donned his father's solar crown and stepped into the         shining chariot. Sensing unfamiliar hands on the reins, the         sun horses thundered off across the sky, veering far off         their usual course.</P>                  <P>Unrestrained, the horses headed through the northern         constellations. Chaos ensued. Warmed by the sun for the         first time ever, the small and great bears became restless.         The usually placid serpent became threatening and the         plowman ran away, even though he was not used to moving         quickly, because of the weight of his plow. The startled         black scorpion prepared to sting Phaeton.</P>                  <P>Panicked, Phaeton let go of the reigns and the chariot         careened haphazardly through the sky. When it fell too close         to the earth, scorching areas into desert, the earth pleaded         for help. Zeus (zoose) came to the earth's rescue, hurling a         mighty lightning bolt, which shattered the chariot into many         pieces. Phaeton tumbled to his death in a river. Mourning         for Phaeton, his sisters turned into poplar trees, from         which their tears flowed and hardened into drops of amber.         </P>                  <P></UL>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Phaeton</B><BR>                  The Greek story of Phaeton was probably based on older tales         that explained eclipses or speculated about the disasters         that would result if the sun ever veered from its regular         path across the sky. Despite many possible interpretations         of Phaeton's story, it is most obviously a metaphor for the         limitless desires, but finite powers, of human beings. The         story was fabulously elaborated upon by the Roman poet Ovid         (AH-vid) in his collection of stories called         <I>Metamorphoses</I>. During the Renaissance the story took         on an entirely new significance.</P>                  <P><B>The Italian Renaissance</B><BR>                  During the 14th and 15th centuries, many Italian cities         became important European centers of industry and trade.         Living conditions improved and people became more interested         in their earthly existence than with life after death, a         significant reversal of the attitudes of their medieval         predecessors. The term Renaissance, meaning "rebirth,"         derives from this renewed interest in life on earth and a         new confidence in humankind's potential for achievement. A         revival of the art and literature of the ancient Greeks and         Romans, which began in the 13th century, contributed to the         humanism of Renaissance Italy and greatly influenced its         art. Renaissance art became increasing         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A> as         artists studied their own world and classical art.</P>                  <P>In order to reconcile the classical past with Christian         beliefs, Renaissance scholars looked for Christian morals in         classical myths whose original meanings were no longer         understood. For example, Phaeton's unsuccessful efforts were         equated with Lucifer's attempts to get too close to god.         Moralizers drew connections between Phaeton's demise and the         Old Testament text of Isaiah 14:12 - "How art thou fallen         from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning." Scenes of         Phaeton falling from his chariot were thus very popular in         Renaissance art.</P>                  <P><B>Cassone</B><BR>                  This type of chest is usually referred to by its Italian         name, <I>cassone</I>. Cassoni (cass-OH-nee) were most often         used as marriage chests to hold brides' household linens.         Especially popular from the 14th to the 16th century,         cassoni usually featured scenes from the classical mythology         so popular at this time. This cassone exemplifies the         Italian Renaissance style of art, particularly in its         attention to the human body, the illusion of realistic         spaces achieved through         <A HREF="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE">PERSPECTIVE</A>         techniques, and its adaptation of classical motifs.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/09a.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="92" X="SAS-UseImageWidth" X="SAS-UseImageHeight" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="8">This cassone tells the story of Phaeton in four         carved panels. The first vignette shows young Phaeton         cavorting with the child who taunted him. Typical of         Renaissance figures, their bodies are turned and their knees         are bent to convey a sense of movement. Their windblown         drapery enhances the sense of action. Their pseudo-Greek         garb and tightly curled hair evoke ancient Greek sculpture.         The artist achieved a believable sense of depth by carving         the frontmost figure in deeper         <A HREF="glossary.html#RELIEF">RELIEF</A>.<BR>                  <BR CLEAR="left">                  In the second panel, Phaeton's mother points in the         direction of the sun, represented as a stern human face with         rays. Phaeton eagerly reaches out toward his father. His         partially nude body is babylike, reminiscent of Greek         carvings of Cupid. Again, action is achieved with billowing         drapery. The artist creates the illusion of space by carving         the doorway behind the figures in low relief and by making         the distant sun very small.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/09b.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="93" X="SAS-UseImageWidth" X="SAS-UseImageHeight" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="8">The third scene shows Phaeton on his knees before         his mighty father, who is here represented as a man standing         on a decorated platform. The marvelous palace of Helios         recalls classical architecture.</P>                  <P>The cassone's final panel shows the image of Phaeton most         familiar during the Renaissance. Phaeton, now represented         fully nude and adult, tumbles from the chariot alongside two         falling horses. The anatomy of Phaeton and the horses is         remarkably well rendered.<BR>                  <BR CLEAR="right">                  Many adaptations of classical motifs decorate this elaborate         cassone. On the corners are harpies - monsters with the         heads and breasts of women and the wings and claws of birds         - which were said to torment misers. Harpies symbolized the         deadly sin of greed (avarice) in many Renaissance moral         allegories. The five heads punctuating the horizontal band         above the main scenes and the single large face at the         center bottom of the chest are variations on satyr and         gorgon masks that often decorated classical architecture.         One face conceals the key hole in its mouth. Around these         faces are anthemia, conventional floral motifs based on the         honeysuckle or palmette. The leaves in the narrow band         around the lid of the cassone are acanthus, another popular         classical decoration.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Questions"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Discussion Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Phaeton.</B> <B>Show image 9         and explain that the cassone tells the story of Phaeton in         the four carved panels.</B> <B>Show image 9a and ask:</B>         What part of the story do you see carved in the first panel         (left)? <B> (Phaeton is taunted by his playmate.)
