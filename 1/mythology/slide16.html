He lived with his parents and two siblings in a small         cottage. Herbert's parents died - his father from typhoid         fever and his mother from pneumonia - when he was very         young. In 1884, 10-year-old "Bertie" moved to Oregon to live         with his uncle, a country doctor. At 17, he entered Stanford         University, from which he graduated with a degree in         engineering.</P>                  <P>Hoover became a very successful mining engineer, making         his fortune operating mines in San Francisco, England,         Australia, and China. When World War I broke out, Hoover         established the American Relief Committee in London at the         request of the United States government, helping more than         100,000 Americans to escape war-torn Europe. Later he         chaired the Commission for Relief in Belgium and served as         the United States Food Administrator. After the war, he         created the American Relief Administration, administering         more than 100 million dollars for clothing and food for         oppressed Europeans and Russians recovering from German         occupation. When government funds for that program ran out,         Hoover secured private contributions to keep it going.</P>                  <P>Hoover's dedication to relief efforts made him a hero.         Both political parties wanted him to become their         presidential candidate. He ran for a time in the 1928         Democratic primaries, but was ultimately victorious as a         Republican candidate. Recognizing the political advantage of         his popular rags-to-riches story, Hoover kicked off his         campaign with a big public rally in his rural hometown. In         1929 the poor orphan boy from Iowa became president of the         United States.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <UL>            <B>Grant Wood</B><BR>                        The artist Grant Wood is something of a legend himself,            another small-town Iowa boy made good. Wood studied art            in Europe for several years but returned to the United            States in the 1920s. Dissatisfied with modern painting            styles, he developed his own style inspired by the            brilliant colors and tiny details of 15th-century Flemish            paintings.                        <P>Responding to a resurgence of nationalism and a new            fascination with the American past, Wood painted many            <A HREF="glossary.html#GENRE">GENRE</A> scenes of            historical and regional interest, including farmhouses,            small-town folk, and the rural landscape. He and other            midwestern artists who painted scenes of Americana were            called Regionalists. Wood emphasized description and            narrative in the same way as the contemporary American            writers he admired. Like Sinclair Lewis, he raised            ordinary experiences of daily life to mythical            proportions.</P>                        <P><B>The Birthplace of Herbert Hoover, West Branch,            Iowa</B><BR>                        Wood places the viewer at the crest of a steep hill,            looking down into a green valley where a tour guide            points to a small cottage beside a larger white house.            But this is not an ordinary cottage - it is the place            where Herbert Hoover was born.<BR>                        <BR>                        Warm midwestern sunshine illuminates the large family            homes, neatly mown lawns, and perfectly clipped trees in            the quiet neighborhood surrounding the cottage. A gentle            breeze blows laundry hanging near the cottage. In the            front, three orange birds fly over a clear blue stream.            Beyond them, toylike chickens peck around logs leaning            against a red barn, and even farther back, two boys in            overalls chat on the sidewalk. A road runs between rows            of shade trees on the right, and a golden field, dotted            with haystacks, extends beyond the houses on the left.            </P>                        <P>Typical of Grant Wood's Regionalist style, everything            is neat and regimented, evoking the simplified forms of            American folk art. Forms, such as the solid, rounded            trees and boxlike houses, are reduced to            <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> shapes.            Many tiny straight brushstrokes define the trim lawns,            creating a rhythmic pattern across much of the painting,            and patterned clumps of enormous autumnal leaves define            the trees. Unrealistically, all of the forms, whether            close or distant, are bathed in the same clear light and            described with the same precise detail.</P>                        <P>Warm autumnal colors - browns, golds, oranges, and            yellow-greens - dominate Wood's painting. The white            siding of the cottage and house create a striking            contrast against the golden-green lawn.</P>                        <P><B>Hoover's Birthplace</B><BR>                        Wood did not re-create the scene as it may have looked at            the president's birth. Instead he painted it as the            tourist attraction it became. Upon Hoover's election to            the presidency, the ordinary cottage, which had been            turned into a kitchen by later owners, began to attract            visitors from all over the country. The owner of the            cottage charged visitors ten cents for tours of it and            set up a souvenir stand. Wood included a sign in front of            the house and a pink rock in which the Daughters of the            American Revolution placed a plaque identifying the house            as Hoover's birthplace.            <HR>            </P>                        <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion            Questions</B></CENTER></P>                        <P><B>Look</B><BR>                        <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Herbert Hoover. </B>What            part of the story do you see in Grant Wood's painting?            <B>(Herbert Hoover's birthplace.)</B> Herbert Hoover was            born in West Branch, Iowa, in 1874.

Could a girl grow up to            be president of the United States? Does a person's race            play a part in his or her ability to achieve the            presidency?
