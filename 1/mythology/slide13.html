At her birth a halo of light danced         around her head. An exceptionally smart youngster, she         studied with seven great scholars. Catherine soon surpassed         all others in nobility, beauty, wealth, and knowledge. Her         father died when she was only 14, leaving her in charge of         the kingdom. Catherine declined, giving up the kingdom in         order to pursue her studies. When her loyal subjects begged         her to reconsider and to marry, Catherine agreed, but         insisted that she would only marry a man who was her social         and financial equal. Furthermore, he must be so beautiful         that angels would wish to see him, and kind enough to         forgive all offenses. Her subjects feared that no one man         could fulfill all of these criteria.</P>                  <P>At this time a religious hermit saw in a vision that the         Christian messiah, Jesus, was the husband Catherine sought.         The hermit shared this divine message with Catherine and         gave her a picture of the baby Jesus with his mother, the         Virgin Mary. Upon seeing the child's face, Catherine knew         she could love no one else.</P>                  <P>When Catherine asked the hermit how she could become         worthy of Jesus, he instructed her in the tenets of         Christianity and baptized her. That night she had a dream in         which the baby Jesus placed a wedding ring on her finger.         When she awoke she found that the ring was still there. From         that moment on Catherine considered herself the bride of         Jesus.</P>                  <P>In the meantime, the Roman emperor Maxentius         (mak-SEN-chus) had come to Alexandria. Maxentius persecuted         all those who refused to worship the idols in which he         believed. Catherine challenged Maxentius. He called in 50 of         his greatest advisors to dispute with her, but they were no         match for her wisdom and power of argument. She converted         them to Christianity. The cruel Maxentius ordered his         advisors burned to death, but he was so enchanted by         Catherine's beauty that he spared her life. Although he was         already married he tried to force Catherine to marry him.         When she refused he tried to starve her into submission.         Angels came to her dungeon cell and fed her. When         Maxentius's wife begged him to have mercy on Catherine, he         had his wife put to death and again tried to force Catherine         into marriage.</P>                  <P>Furious at her repeated refusals, Maxentius ordered         Catherine tied to four spinning spiked wheels that would         tear her apart. A great flame flashed down from the heavens         and burned the wheels, and their hot fragments killed         Catherine's executioners. Finally Maxentius had Catherine         beheaded. Angels carried her body to the top of Mount Sinai.         Maxentius soon died, himself condemned to a horrible death.         </P>                  <P>         <HR ALIGN=LEFT>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B>Hypatia</B><BR>                  Many elements of the Saint Catherine legend are similar to         those of the life of an ancient philosopher named Hypatia         (high-PAY-shuh). During the 4th century, Alexandria, Egypt,         was the Western world's intellectual, scientific, and         philosophic center. It was also the site of tremendous         turmoil as Christianity gained political and intellectual         power. Although Hypatia taught so-called pagan philosophies         in Alexandria, she was given special treatment by Christian         leaders in the city. She died in 415, evidently murdered by         a group of fanatical monks.</P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B>Saint Catherine</B><BR>                  Whatever her origins, Saint Catherine of Alexandria was one         of the most popular Christian saints in Europe during the         later Middle Ages. Jacobus de Voragine (ja-KOH-bus duh         ve-RAJ-i-nee) popularized the story of her martyrdom in his         well-known collection of saints' lives, called <I>The Golden         Legend</I>. She was the patron saint of young girls,         students, clergy, philosophers, and craftspeople, such as         wheelwrights, spinners, and millers, whose work centered on         the wheel. Perhaps because of her association with Hypatia,         the Catholic Church considered Catherine's history         unreliable and removed her from its calendar of saints in         1969.</P>                  <P><B>Sculpture</B><BR>                  During the 14th century, artists regularly included Saint         Catherine in large-scale altarpieces. Rows of standing         saints typically flanked a central figure of Christ or the         Virgin Mary. These sculptures were used to educate the         illiterate and to inspire devotion.</P>                  <P>Altarpiece saints were often carved from linden wood,         also known as limewood, which grew in the dense forests of         southern Germany and Austria. Sculptors prized the expensive         linden wood because its uniform grain enabled them to carve         out complex drapery patterns without cracking the wood.         People believed that linden wood had magical qualities, and         its leaves, seeds, and flowers were used in medicines.         Images were thought to be more powerful when carved from         this magical wood.</P>                  <P><B>Saint Catherine of Alexandria</B><BR>                  This 15th-century linden wood sculpture from Austria         probably stood in a large elevated altarpiece. The back of         the sculpture is hollowed out, indicating that only the         front was meant to be seen. Catherine is depicted as a         graceful young woman. She stands tall on the back of a small         prone figure of Maxentius, showing the triumph of faith over         evil. Her crown indicates her royal status. She raises her         hand in blessing and looks down benevolently at the viewer.         </P>                  <P>Catherine, renowned for her beauty, has long, wavy hair.         Her stocky body and her idealized facial features - small         delicate red mouth, small sharp chin, long narrow nose,         broad cheeks, and high forehead - are typical of Austrian         and German Gothic representations of female saints. Traces         of paint indicate that her face was painted creamy white.         She wears a fashionable 15th-century ensemble of a         high-waisted gown, loose outer cloak, and pointed shoes.         Traces of color show that her cloak was once         <A HREF="glossary.html#GILDING">GILDED</A> and the lining         was painted blue. The red patches are remnants of the glue         used to attach the <A HREF="glossary.html#GOLD">GOLD         LEAF</A>.</P>                  <P>Catherine delicately lifts the hem of her cape as she         steps over Maxentius. The folds of her voluminous drapery         are crinkled and brittle. Because of these sharp, angular         folds, the late Gothic manner in which she is carved is         called the "hard style."         <HR ALIGN=LEFT>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look<BR>                  1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Saint Catherine.</B> The artist         who made this sculpture used         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</A> to tell viewers         about Catherine's life. <B>Review the meaning of symbol:         something that stands for or represents another thing or         idea. </B>What does Catherine's crown symbolize?         <B>(Royalty.)</B> Can you find a symbol of the evil she         overcame?

Why or why not? What is considered beautiful         changes over time and is different for each person. Saint         Catherine's facial features are typical of German and         Austrian Gothic standards of beauty. If you were to carve a         sculpture of a beautiful person, would it look different         than Saint Catherine? Would any of the features be like         Saint Catherine's?</P>                  <P><B>2.</B> Although it is not apparent in the image, the         sculptor who carved Saint Catherine hollowed out the         sculpture from the back and left the back open and         unfinished. Why? <B>(This sculpture was not meant to be         viewed "in the round," but rather set against a wall on an         altar; the viewer wouldn't see the back. Also, a hollow         sculpture is lighter in weight, easier to move, and less         likely to crack.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Even though Catherine died at the hands of         Maxentius, Europeans during the Middle Ages considered her         triumphant. Why? <B>(Catherine represented the virtue of         defending one's beliefs, even in the face of death. Her         reward for her bravery, according to Christian mythology,         was a place in the kingdom of heaven.)</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> The story and sculpture of Saint Catherine tell         us about the triumph of good over evil. What other stories         can you think of about good overcoming evil? <B>(Cinderella,         Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, the Little         Mermaid.)</B> Which other works of art have you seen whose         subject is the triumph of good over evil?         <B>(<A HREF="slide4.html">Memorial tusk, image 4</A>;         <A HREF="slide10.html">Theseus, image 10</A>;         <A HREF="slide12.html">Medusa, image 12</A>;         <A HREF="slide14.html">Mary Magdalene, image 14</A>; </B>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
