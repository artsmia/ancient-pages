Orpheus became a         great musician. His voice was more melodious than any other         mortal's. The songs he sang and the tunes he played on his         lyre enchanted gods, mortals, and beasts alike; even stones         and trees came to him when he played.<BR>                  <BR>                  Orpheus married the beautiful nymph Eurydice. But on their         wedding day a poisonous snake bit her and she died.         Desperate to be reunited with his beloved Eurydice, Orpheus         journeyed to the Underworld to beg the king and queen there         to return Eurydice to him. As he sang his plea and played         his lyre, even the cold spirits of the Underworld wept. The         king and queen granted the couple permission to leave         together on the condition that Orpheus must not look back at         Eurydice until they were both completely out of the         Underworld. Silently they made the arduous, dark climb. But         at the opening to the world, Orpheus, in his love for         Eurydice, turned and looked at her. She slipped back into         the darkness.<BR>                  <BR>                  Orpheus returned to his world, where his music became even         more moving, reflecting his suffering over the loss of         Eurydice. He wandered despondent through the woods and         refused the love of other women. This so angered the local         women that they tore Orpheus to pieces and tossed his head         and lyre into the river. Still singing out the name of         Eurydice, his head floated out to sea. Orpheus's spirit         returned to the Underworld, where he was happily reunited         with Eurydice.<BR>                  <BR>                           <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Orpheus</B><BR>                  Although many well-known ancient writers wrote about         Orpheus, his history is muddled. By the 5th century B.C.,         the Greeks considered Orpheus the founder of an early         religion and a religious teacher. His mythology and fame as         a singer derived from sacred texts ascribed to him.<BR>                  <BR>                  The Orpheus myth warns that death is inevitable, that even         the power of song cannot save one from death. But it also         reconciles life and death, suggesting that death is actually         the beginning of a new life.<BR>                  <BR>                  Since ancient times, Orpheus has represented the supreme         power of poetry and music to enchant all natural things. It         was Orpheus the musician who attracted the painter Maurice         Denis.<BR>                  <BR>                  <B>Maurice Denis and the Symbolists</B><BR>                  Early in his career, Denis associated with a group of         artists called Symbolists. The Symbolists challenged the         value of naturalism as an artistic goal. Instead, they used         bright and often arbitrary colors, curving lines, flat         forms, and unusual compositions to transform the real world         into personal symbolic statements.<BR>                  <BR>                  The Symbolists sought an ideal synthesis of the arts.         Maurice Denis's paintings incorporated elements and themes         from the other arts; he believed, for example, that painting         could have musical qualities and that color, line, and form         were inherently musical and could convey a sense of rhythm         and harmony. Denis collaborated with writers, poets,         composers, performers, and critics. Among Denis's many         interdisciplinary projects was a 1912-13 series of paintings         on the history of music, including an image of Orpheus, in         the Theatre des Champs-Elysees (tay-AH-truh day         SHANZ-ay-leez-ay) in Paris.<BR>                  <BR>                  Orpheus and his mythology represented the vital synthesis of         poetry, music, and the other arts, so important to Denis and         his Symbolist colleagues. Orpheus's reputation as a         religious and artistic teacher also endeared him to artists         of this era who, like Denis, were interested in the         spiritual qualities of art.<BR>                  <BR>                  Orpheus and In the painting Orpheus and Eurydice Denis uses         rich and pale Eurydice greens, purples, browns, whites, and         blues to evoke an idyllic moment of humans in harmony with         nature. It is a beautiful spring day with a bright blue sky,         fluffy white clouds, and a blanket of lush green and         lavender flowers. No single figure dominates. Even Orpheus         does not take center stage; rather, he stands to the right,         playing his lyre and charming all who have gathered to hear         him. He wears a laurel crown, a cherished prize in ancient         Greece, awarded to the best poets and musicians.<BR>                  <BR>                  Denis believed that a truly harmonious painting was one that         achieved a balance between nature and imagination. Artists         had to be able to rationally organize their emotional         responses to nature in their art. He achieves that balance         in this painting. Orpheus's white-clad audience, from the         frontmost reclining woman to the embracing couple on the         right, forms an open-ended circle around the musician. By         gradually reducing the size of the figures, Denis guides the         viewer back into the forest. Kneeling beneath an arched         bower in the painting's         <A HREF="glossary.html#MIDDLEGROUND">MIDDLEGROUND</A>,         Eurydice raises her hands in approval of Orpheus's song. The         sequence of figures creates a gentle rhythm that carries         through the picture. The vertical trees impose a subtle         restraint on the scene, though even they, like the standing         Orpheus, curve gently, contributing to the overall         harmony.<BR>                  <BR>                  Denis's harmonious painting only hints at the tragedy that         would befall the lovers. By isolating Eurydice under the         hedge, he physically separates her from all of the other         figures.</UL>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</CENTER></B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> Tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.

The         Symbolists sought an ideal synthesis of all the arts -         visual arts, music, poetry, theater.
