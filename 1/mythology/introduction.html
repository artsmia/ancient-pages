This complex question has been answered by         many different people in many different ways. Myth is         frequently defined as an accepted belief that is         unsubstantiated by fact or as any body of stories that         explain the way things are. Myth is also sometimes         characterized as stories belonging to cultures that no         longer exist. Some people consider any belief system that is         not their own to be myth. For many, myth may just be the         stories of the ancient Greeks and Romans. None of these         definitions, however, is satisfactory.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Myths, as conveyors of information, are imaginative         vehicles for making the inexplicable clear. Even though they         deal with things that are not literally true, they are         nevertheless truths in some higher sense-spiritual,         philosophical, or social.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                        <P>Myths can fall anywhere on a continuum ranging from nearly pure historical         account to pure imagination. The content and form of a myth can change         to suit the needs of the teller, the audience, and the purpose for which         it is being told. A myth can thus take on a life of its own. The nature         of the Egyptian god Osiris, for example, changed tremendously over centuries;         once considered only a god of vegetation, he came to be the god of the         underworld, the god of the moon, a divine pharaoh, and much, much more.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Art is often an integral part of mythmaking and telling.         Like the writers and poets who give written form to myths         long passed on through oral tradition, artists provide         visual forms. An artist's representation provides a concrete         mental picture of a myth or mythological character, as in         the Antimenes painter's image of Athena meeting Herakles         with her chariot. In some instances, as with the         <A HREF="slide4.html">memorial tusk from Benin</A> , a work         of art can trigger a story. While some representations, such         as the <A HREF="slide2.html">Egyptian statue of Thoth</A>,         are largely dictated by tradition, others such as Maurice         Denis's painting of <A HREF="slide11.html">Orpheus and         Eurydice</A>, are more personal. Regardless of why or how it         was created, each image contributes an added dimension to         our understanding or interpretation of that myth.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Many of the images in this collection represent myths         that explain a practice, belief, institution, or natural         phenomenon. The <A HREF="slide5.html">Yoruba king's         crown</A>, the <A HREF="slide8.html">Roman furniture         decoration</A>, and the abstract designs on the         <A HREF="slide17.html">Navajo ketoh</A> and the         <A HREF="slide19.html">Lakota dress</A> refer to creation         stories. The <A HREF="slide6.html">Bamana antelope         headdress</A> symbolizes Chi Wara, who taught the Bamana         people how to plant, and the pig carved on a         <A HREF="slide20.html">pole</A> evokes a story that explains         the traditional social organization of the people of New         Ireland.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Other images refer to myths based on known people and         events. These are often called legends or sagas to         distinguish them from explanatory stories. Some of the myths         interpreted by artists in this collection are clearly rooted         in documentable reality. For example, the story of         <A HREF="slide15.html">Nebuchadnezzar</A> is based on the         life of a ruler of the ancient Babylonian empire, and the         story recounted on the carved <A HREF="slide4.html">tusk         from Benin</A> is based entirely on established         personalities and events. Often, the historical details of a         story are sacrificed for fictional, more entertaining ones.         <A HREF="slide16.html">Grant Wood's painting</A> depicts the         birthplace of a well-known U.S. president while also making         wry commentary on the process of mythmaking itself.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Hero myths, tales of adventure filled with fantastic         beings and superhuman feats, are also represented in this         collection. The stories told through the images of         <A HREF="slide3.html">Isis</A>,         <A HREF="slide10.html">Theseus</A>, the         <A HREF="slide23.html">Nio guardians</A>, and         <A HREF="slide13.html">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</A>, to         name a few, present a broad range of heroic acts achieved         through clever magic, physical strength, and devout faith.         </P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>As the richness of the myths represented in this         collection convey, myth and falsehood are not synonymous.         What is truth to one is fancy to another; however, it is not         up to any of us to decide that one community's mythology is         any more or less valid than another's. Myth is a positive         force that unites many cultures rather than divides them.         Throughout the world myths provide people with explanations,         histories, role models, entertainment, and so many other         things that enable them to direct their own actions and         understand their own surroundings more clearly.      </TD></TR></TABLE> <!--------Bottom Myth Menu------><p></P><P><HR NOSHADE><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="445">  <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER>          <a href="index.html">World Mythology</a> ~ <a href="mythbyimage.html">Myth           by Image</a> ~ <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~           <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~ <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A>           ~ <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~ <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable           Resources</A> ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How           to Order</A>         </CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE><p></P></BODY></HTML>
