When his daughter Nut (newt)         fell in love with the god Geb (gebb), Shu was wildly         jealous. To keep the lovers far apart, he turned Nut into         the sky and Geb into the earth. Then he cursed Nut with         barrenness, proclaiming that there were no months of the         year in which she could give birth.</P>                  <P>Thoth, the god of the moon, time, and measure, took pity         on Nut and Geb. He challenged the reigning gods to a game of         dice and soundly beat them all. As his prize he asked the         gods to give him five days in addition to those that already         existed. Thoth in turn presented the five extra days to the         sky goddess, Nut. Because these five extra days did not         belong to any particular month, they did not fall under         Shu's curse. Thus, the goddess was able to use them to         produce five children, including Osiris (oh-SIGH-rus) and         Isis (EYE-sus).</P>                  <P>Prior to Thoth's gift, each of the twelve months of the         Egyptian calendar had 30 days, resulting in a 360-day year.         Thoth's act of kindness reconciled the Egyptian calendar         with the earth's actual 365-day cycle.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Thoth</B><BR>                  Thoth had many roles. In addition to being the god of the         moon, the god of wisdom, and the measurer of time, he was         scribe, moralist, messenger, and supreme magician. The         ancient Egyptians credited him with inventing writing. He         was the patron god of all arts, sciences, and intellectual         pursuits. Ancient Egyptians believed that before the dead         could enter the Afterworld, their hearts were weighed         against a feather of truth to determine whether they had led         good and honest lives. In his role as scribe, Thoth recorded         the results of each judgment.</P>                  <P><B>26th Dynasty</B><BR>                  The 26th Dynasty began in 663 B.C., when a shrewd Egyptian         prince tricked the ruling Assyrians into leaving Egypt. By         increasing business and trade with many neighboring         cultures, including the Ionian Greeks, Egypt became a         leading exporter of grain and a dominant power in the         Mediterranean world. This brief period of independent rule         lasted until 525 B.C., when the Persians overran Egypt.</P>                  <P><B>Votive Figures</B><BR>                  In ancient Egypt, all events, large and small, were         attributed to the influence of the gods. Only through         worship and offerings to these gods could humans expect to         maintain balance in their lives. People placed small votive         statues of gods at burial sites, inviting the gods to         inhabit the sculptures and protect the deceased from evil.         Other figures were used as offerings at temples. Artists         mass-produced many bronze statuettes during the prosperous         26th Dynasty.</P>                  <P><B>Thoth</B><BR>                  This bronze statuette depicts Thoth in a typical manner, as         a man with the head of an ibis, a large bird of the Nile.         Egyptians associated the ibis's long curved beak with the         moon, so the ibis was regarded as one of Thoth's earthly         representatives. Thoth wears a simple loincloth and a long         wig, both decorated with rows of fine lines. The holes in         his hands suggest that they once held objects, probably a         reed pen, an attribute of Thoth's role as a scribe, and         either a palette for writing on or a staff, symbolizing his         power.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/02a.gif" WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=134         ALIGN=left hspace=8><B>Crown</B><BR>                  Thoth's crown is filled with symbols. (See detail.) The         central part is the crown of Upper Egypt worn by pharaohs,         which means he was considered earthly royalty. The feathers         of truth on each side of the center refer to Thoth's role in         the judgment of the dead. The solar disc at the top         indicates his cosmic powers, the serpents with smaller discs         on the outsides symbolize his sovereignty, and the ram horns         at the base attest to his strength and         virility.<BR clear=left>                  </P>                  <P><B>Style</B><BR>                  The style and form of this seated statuette of Thoth are         typical of this period in Egyptian art. Following a period         of realism, artists of the 26th Dynasty emulated the more         stylized traditional Egyptian art. The symmetry of the         piece, Thoth's rigid pose, and the formal attributes all         recall the traditional style. The naturalistic curves of         Thoth's torso, arms, and legs, however, suggest the         influence of Greek art during this period of great trade         between the two cultures.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Questions"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Discussion Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Thoth. </B>Does the sculpture         of Thoth contain any elements of Thoth's story? <B>(No!)</B>         The sculpture represents Thoth as a man with the head of an         ibis.
