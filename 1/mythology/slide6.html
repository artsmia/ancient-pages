From infancy Chi Wara tilled the         earth using his claws and a <I>sunsun</I> tree stick his         mother gave him. He magically transformed weeds into millet         and corn and taught people to do the same. He also taught         them the value of hard work. Thanks to Chi Wara, the people         became excellent and prosperous farmers.</P>                  <P>When crops were plentiful the people forgot about the         lessons of the farming animal and became less conscientious         about their farming. Chi Wara, disheartened, buried himself         in the earth. Then the people began to have difficulties         with their crops. When they realized that Chi Wara was gone,         they were sorry they had taken him for granted. They created         a small mound in which his spirit could reside forever. They         also created dance headdresses in the form of the farming         animal, to honor him and to remind themselves of the virtues         he had taught.<BR>                           <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>The Bamana</B><BR>                  Most Bamana communities rely on farming for their survival.         Living in west central Mali in Africa, Bamana farmers must         struggle to produce crops from the poor soil of the dry         savanna land. Traditional Bamana religious beliefs and         ritual glorify agriculture and honor successful farmers.         </P>                  <P>The ideal Bamana farmer works the land from sunrise to         sunset, never straying from his task. He hoes with pride,         perseverance, and joy. His fields are always free of weeds,         and his harvests are always of the highest quality. This         ideal farmer, therefore, must be strong in body and spirit,         conscientious, and determined. While few can achieve this         ideal, those who do or who come close are called Chi Wara.         <I>Chi Wara</I> translates as "farming animal" and is         understood in most Bamana villages to mean "excellent         farmer."</P>                  <P><B>Chi Wara Performance</B><BR>                  At planting time, many young Bamana farmers compete in a         hoeing contest. Friends and relatives cheer them on and         masked male dancers wearing elegantly carved Chi Wara         headdresses in the form of antelopes perform to honor and         encourage them. Chi Wara, though not an antelope, has come         to be associated with this elegant animal whose grace and         strength are held up as desirable qualities for champion         farmers. The antelope's prolific reproduction rate also         associates it with fertility and successful growth.</P>                  <P>Chi Wara performers dance in pairs, representing the male         and female antelope. The male is associated with the sun,         and the female, almost always shown with a baby on her back,         the earth. Together they symbolize the necessity of         cooperation between the sun and earth and men and women to         the survival of the Bamana. Their fiber costumes represent         the equally essential water.</P>                  <P>Bent over and leaning on two short sticks of sunsun wood         as forelegs, the Chi Wara dancers move to the powerful         rhythms of drums and women's songs of praise for the         farmers. Inviting the hoers to mimic them, the dancers bend         their heads like antelopes, as if to break the earth with         their horns. The male's dance is the more athletic,         incorporating leaps and passages of fast running. The male         makes screeching noises, while the female is silent.</P>                  <P>As the Bamana respond to the influence of other cultures,         especially the growing popularity of Islam, many of their         own traditions have become diluted. The men's associations         that once maintained social control and oversaw village         masquerades are losing their significance. As a result, many         masquerades have ceased altogether. The annual ceremonies to         honor Chi Wara are practiced only rarely today, and few         Bamana know the entire legend of Chi Wara.</P>                  <P><B>Antelope Headdress</B><BR>                  This Chi Wara headdress, sculpted by an artist of the         western Bamana, represents a male antelope with long         sweeping horns and neck. The exaggerated horns, nearly twice         the length of his body, dominate the figure. On each side,         the animal's long ear continues the sweeping line of these         horns. The prominent ears stress the value of hearing to the         Bamana; when a man hears of ancestral accomplishments, he is         encouraged to aspire to the same legendary virtues. The         figure has almond-shaped eyes and a short mane. Its head         rests on top of a long collared neck, which extends from its         small body.</P>                  <P>The animal's back is slightly curved and its tail is         tightly curled. Its hind and front legs are bent, perhaps in         anticipation of a leap. The long curving lines of his head,         horns, and body and the spaces created by his bent legs and         curly tail form a graceful silhouette.         <A HREF="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERNS</A> of lines         animate the figure: curving diagonal lines wrapping around         Chi Wara's horns, smaller lines run down his head and back,         a band of crisscrosses decorates his face, and a row of         three triangles lines his snout.</P>                  <P>The wooden form of Chi Wara is attached to a basketlike         cap made from rattan, cotton, and leather.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Chi Wara.</B> Look carefully         at the headdress made by a Bamana artist to represent Chi         Wara. What kind of animal is Chi Wara?
