Peaches were, therefore,            associated with good health, marriage, and long life.                        <LI>During the Ch'ing (ching) dynasty, luxury objects            were often decorated with SYMBOLS and stories referring            to prosperity and good fortune.                        <LI>The artist varied the colors and TEXTURES of the            layers of LACQUER on this box to indicate depth.         </UL>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Story"></A><B>Story</B></CENTER></P>                  <P>Long, long ago a woman named Hsi Wang-mu (she wong-moo)         ruled over the Land of the Immortals in the Kunlun (cun-lun)         mountains. Her incredible mountain residence was renowned         for its marble and jasper buildings, nine-storied tower,         sparkling brooks, and especially for its beautiful gardens.         In the Land of the Immortals, bountiful peach trees grew.         One of the peach trees in Hsi Wang-mu's orchard blossomed         only once every 3,000 years. Its luscious fruit took an         additional 3,000 years to ripen. Anyone lucky enough to eat         the magical fruit of this tree was granted immortality. When         the peaches were harvested, Hsi Wang-mu held a huge         celebration and feast at her home, at which her mortal         visitors ate the precious peaches. She also invited the         immortals to taste the fruit, since they, too, had to wait         6,000 years to enjoy this amazing delicacy.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Ch'ien Lung</B><BR>                  The Ch'ing dynasty emperor Ch'ien Lung (CHEE-en lung), who         reigned from 1736 to 1795, was a devoted art collector         andpatron. He encouraged artists to produce many luxury         objects, including fine lacquer presentation boxes, made as         gifts for members of the court.</P>                  <P><B>Lacquer</B><BR>                  Asian lacquer comes from the sap of the lac tree. It is a         thick, sticky substance rather like honey. Artists apply         many thin layers of lacquer on wood objects, allowing each         layer to harden for weeks before adding another. By applying         layers in different colors, artists could then carve down         through the layers to reveal various colors.</P>                  <P><B>Symbols</B><BR>                  Artists often decorated luxury objects with images and with         symbols of prosperity and good fortune. Rather than tell         stories literally (that would be too obvious) the Chinese         used familiar symbols and images that recalled the story.         </P>                  <P>Besides evoking stories, symbols can reveal the         intentions and views of Heaven. Such symbols often appeared         in everyday contexts. A series of earthquakes meant that         Heaven was displeased; an early blossoming or the appearance         of a crane might herald the coming of good fortune. By using         symbols such as the peach, artists recorded a general wish         for other heavenly signs of impending happiness and long         life.</P>                  <P><B>Peaches</B><BR>                  Peaches suggest many things in traditional Chinese culture.         They were considered good medicine for everything from         rheumatism to coughs. Children wore peach stones carved in         the shapes of locks around their necks to keep them from         harm. The peach is commonly associated with springtime,         marriage, fertility, and long life.</P>                  <P><B>Presentation Box</B><BR>                  The superb craftsmanship, intricate composition, and         elaborate detail of this lacquer presentation box are common         features of the fine lacquer produced during the reign of         emperor Ch'ien Lung. It was probably made as a gift for a         member of the nobility or even for the emperor.</P>                  <P><B>Symbols</B><BR>                  This presentation box is covered with many symbols that wish         its recipient good luck and happiness. On top is a large         character meaning "spring," which was considered one of the         most fruitful and pleasant seasons. The peach was another         symbol for springtime. Below that is an elegant bowl filled         with symbols of wealth - coins and rhinoceros horns.         Illustrated on the sides are legends concerning immortality.         The combination of signs of spring, wealth, children, and         long life suggests that this presentation box was made as a         wedding gift or a birthday present.</P>                  <P><B>Description</B><BR>                  The front of the box (see detail) shows the legend of Hsi         Wang-mu's giant peach trees in the Land of the Immortals.         The land is a beautiful paradise of lofty mountains, cool         wavy seas, and lush vegetation. On the left, a peach tree         grows out of the side of a cliff; the immense peaches dwarf         the tree itself. Luckily for the immortals, the branches         hang low enough that the peaches can be picked.</P>                  <P>Two young boys and a wrinkled old man pick the luscious         fruit. The old man is the god of longevity. His staff bears         the character <I>shou</I> (show), meaning "long life."         Standing on a ledge, one boy picks the peaches and hands         them to the god of longevity, who cradles them in a long         cloth. Behind the old man, the other child picks off the         leaves and places the peaches in a basket.</P>                  <P>Although the scene looks natural, it is carefully and         decoratively composed. The figures stand on ground that is         made up of a <A HREF="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</A> of         squares and small flowers. The waves are reduced to a         repetitive weave of diagonal lines.</P>                  <P>The artist, in a typical Chinese fashion, has created a         sense of depth by tilting up the ground plane, so that more         distant forms are set higher in the composition. The stream         winds upward into the distance.         <A HREF="glossary.html#PERSPECTIVE"> PERSPECTIVE</A> shifts         within the scene so that one can simultaneously look up at         the mountains and down on the heads of the figures.</P>                  <P>The artist also used color and texture to distinguish         between <A HREF="glossary.html#FOREGROUND"> FOREGROUND</A>         and <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND"> BACKGROUND</A>         forms. The black areas, deeply carved, form the water and         the sky. Closer, the landscape forms a red backdrop for the         figures and peaches, which, though also red, are carved from         an even shallower layer of lacquer.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> This presentation box is covered with many         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</A> that wish the         box's owner good luck and happiness.
