They floated for many days and nights until         the wind and waves carried them to the shores of Provence in         southern France. The local people did not share the beliefs         of the castaways and refused them food and shelter. The         tattered group finally found refuge in a temple. There, Mary         and Martha preached the word of Jesus, performed miracles,         and converted thousands of the people to their faith.</P>                  <P>Mary regretted many of the things she had done in her         youth. Wishing to repent, she devoted herself to a life of         solitary contemplation in the wilderness. For thirty years         she lived as a hermit in a cave prepared for her by angels.         Over time, her clothes rotted away and her hair grew and         grew until it covered her entire body.</P>                  <P>During the last years of Mary's life, a host of angels         lifted her toward the heavens seven times a day. One day a         local priest witnessed this event. Mary identified herself         to the dumbstruck priest and sent him to tell the bishop to         look for her on a specified day. On that day the bishop         forgave Mary for the sins of her youth. Mary then died and         her soul rose to heaven. After her death, Mary continued to         perform miracles for those who prayed to her.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Mary Magdalene</B><BR>                  Mary of Magdala, better known as Mary Magdalene, is referred         to in Mark's gospel in the Bible's New Testament as the         woman from whom Jesus cast seven devils (16:9). Mark also         identifies her as one of three Marys who anoint Jesus' body         after his crucifixion (16:1), and as the first person Jesus         sees after his resurrection (16:9). Later traditions         identified her as the unnamed prostitute described in Luke's         gospel who was forgiven her sins by Jesus, after she washed         his feet with her tears and dried them with her hair (7:36).         During the Middle Ages, Mary Magdalene came to exemplify the         faithful and repentant sinner. She stood as a message to         Catholic believers that no one, except the devil, is beyond         forgiveness and redemption. By 1500, during the age of the         Counter Reformation, pictures of Mary Magdalene came to         represent the Roman Catholic Church itself, whose excesses         could also be forgiven through Christ's love.</P>                  <P><B>Saints</B><BR>                  The story of Mary Magdalene's work, exile, and death was         recounted in a popular 13th-century collection of stories         called <I>The Golden Legend</I> by Jacobus de Voragine         (ja-KOH-bus duh ve-RAJ-i-nee). <I>The Golden Legend</I> was         essentially a layperson's version of the lectionaries, or         lives of the saints, which were read on each saint's feast         day during the year. As an archbishop of Genoa, Voragine was         familiar with these texts known chiefly to church clerks.         </P>                  <P>The saints - the heroes of the Middle Ages and         Renaissance - were role models of perfection, possessing         divine wisdom, super strength, and unwavering devotion.         These exemplars of Christian virtues frequently appeared in         altarpiece paintings, inspiring worshipers to emulate their         behavior.</P>                  <P><B>The Elevation Elevation of the Magdalen</B><BR>                  Peter Strub's (stroob) painting <I>The Elevation Elevation         of the Magdalen </I> shows Mary, covered with hair, being         lifted up by 14 angels. A golden halo surrounds her         idealistically youthful face, which shows no signs of her         30-year stay in the wilderness. Her abundantly flowing red         hair is a common         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTE</A>, referring         to her humble drying of Jesus' feet. Far less typical is the         animal-like fur that covers much of her idealized body. Mary         folds her hands over her chest, which is not covered by fur.         Her knees are also exposed, all hair evidently worn away         from kneeling in constant prayer. The angels discreetly         cover her lower abdomen with a crisply draped cloth. From         the mountainous landscape below, a priest looks up at the         miraculous vision.</P>                  <P><B>Style</B><BR>                  Peter Str&uuml;b's tempera painting <I>The Elevation of the         Magdalen</I> is for the most part typical of German         Renaissance art. The flat gold         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>, a         characteristic feature of medieval art, remained a popular         tradition in religious painting well into the Renaissance.         The gold suggests that the subject is holy and bathed in         heavenly light. By contrast, the detailed landscape below         Mary is very much a part of the earthly realm. Typical of         German painters of his era who rendered their native         landscape in great detail, Strub painted Mary Magdalene in a         mountainous German landscape, rather than in southern         France. Fine realistic details abound, from the leafy trees         and craggy rocks to the individual hairs of Mary's fur suit         and the soft feathers of the angels' wings. This attention         to detail is one of the most characteristic traits of German         Renaissance art.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</CENTER></B> <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Mary         Magdalene.</B> What parts of the story do you see in this         painting? <B>(A priest witnesses a host of angels lifting         Mary up to heaven.)</B> How can you tell it's a priest?         <B>(Ecclesiastic clothing.)</B> How can you tell they are         angels? <B>(Wings.)</B> How many angels are there?         <B>(Fourteen.)</B><BR>                  <BR>                  <B>2.</B> Attention to details is one of the most         characteristic traits of German         <A HREF="glossary.html#RENAISSANCE">RENAISSANCE</A> art.         What details has this artist carefully described? <B>(Mary's         hair, the folds of angels' costumes, angels' wings, leaves         and rocks in landscape.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Below Mary is a detailed         <A HREF="glossary.html#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISTIC</A>         landscape.

Why might         an artist use gold on a background? <B>Explain the         popularity of using gold as a background in religious         painting to indicate a sacred subject and to reflect         light.</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> Str&uuml;b and his contemporaries during the         German <A HREF="glossary.html#RENAISSANCE">RENAISSANCE</A>         sought to <A HREF="glossary.html#IDEALIZED">IDEALIZE</A>         their subjects. They believed that artists should strive to         represent perfection even if that perfection was absent in         real nature. For example, the story of Mary Magdalene tells         us that hair grew over her entire body, but Str&uuml;b did         not paint hair on Mary's knees and breasts. Lack of hair on         Mary's knees suggests her kneeling in prayer, while lack of         hair on Mary's breasts signifies her ideal feminine beauty.         How else has Str&uuml;b idealized his subject? Clue: The         story of Mary Magdalene tells us she lived in a cave for 30         years before angels daily lifted her toward heaven! Does         Mary look as if she lived in a cave for 30 years in this         painting? Why not?</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  <B>Think</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> During the Middle Ages, Mary Magdalene served as a         reminder to Catholics that every one may be forgiven. Have         you ever regretted anything you have done? Were you         forgiven? How? What happened? Have you ever forgiven anyone         else?</P>                  <P><B>2.</B> Which other works of art have you seen in this         image set that represent a story in which the character was         forgiven? <B>(Herakles on the         <I><A HREF="slide7.html">hydria</I>, image 7</A>.)</B> Why         did Herakles need forgiveness? <B>(He murdered his         family.)</B> What did Herakles have to do to be forgiven?         <B>(He performed the 12 Labors, including slaying the Nemean         Lion and the Wild Boar of Erymanthus.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Str&uuml;b painted Mary in a German landscape         rather than the landscape of southern France, where she         actually lived. Why might he have done this? <B>(Although we         don't know for sure, Str&uuml;b may not have known the         landscape of southern France. He also may have wanted to         associate his homeland with a holy event.)</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> During the Middle Ages, many people looked to         the saints as behavioral role models.
