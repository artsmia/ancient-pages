Here lived six beings: First Man,         First Woman, Salt Woman, Fire God, Coyote, and Begochiddy,         the golden-haired child of the Sun. Begochiddy made four         mountains in this first world - white to the east; blue to         the south; yellow to the west; and black to the north. Then         Begochiddy made insects and plants. But conflicts arose and         the first beings, tired of the First World and its darkness,         decided to leave.</P>                  <P>At the center of the First World, Begochiddy made a red         mountain and planted a giant reed. The first beings gathered         all of Begochiddy's creations and crawled inside of the         hollow reed. The reed grew and grew and carried them into         the Second World. In the Second World, which was blue,         Begochiddy created still more new things. When the Cat         People, who lived in the Second World, fought the newcomers,         First Man used magic to overcome them. Conflicts again         disrupted the harmony of this world and the first beings         collected their possessions and travelled in the giant reed         up to the Third World.</P>                  <P>The Third World was beautiful, yellow and filled with         light. There, Begochiddy created rivers and springs, animals         and birds, trees and lightning, and many kinds of human         beings. When the men and women began to quarrel, Begochiddy         separated them. But they were so unhappy that Begochiddy         reunited them, warning that the Third World would be flooded         if there was any more trouble.</P>                  <P>And then Coyote caused trouble. Walking by the river, he         spied in the water a baby with long black hair. He lifted         the baby from the river and hid it under his blanket,         telling no one. Colorful storms and torrential rains         approached from all directions. Everyone fled to the         protective hollow of the giant reed, which carried them         upward. But the reed stopped growing before it reached the         next world. So Locust helped Begochiddy make a hole that led         to the Fourth World, an island surrounded by water.</P>                  <P>Seeing the waters still rising in the Third World,         Begochiddy asked who had angered the Water Monster. Coyote         tightened his blanket about his body and Begochiddy ordered         him to open it. There was the water baby. Coyote returned         the baby to the Third World and the waters receded. In the         Fourth World, Begochiddy set out the mountains and placed         the moon, sun, and stars in the sky. Begochiddy taught         everyone the right way to live, including how to care for         plants such as corn, squash, and beans, and how to give         thanks.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>The Navajo</B><BR>                  The Navajo call themselves Dine (DEE-nay), meaning "the         people." They migrated from northwestern Canada sometime         around 1400 to what is now the southwest region of the         United States. The early Navajo were nomadic hunters. They         learned farming and weaving from the native Pueblo peoples,         with whom they also developed trade networks.</P>                  <P>Since the 16th century, various peoples, including the         Spanish, Mexicans, and Euro-Americans, tried to control the         Navajo. But their sophisticated native culture remained         strong. The United States Army began an aggressive campaign         against the Navajo in 1863, destroying their livestock and         crops. Many Navajo were then forced onto government         reservations.</P>                  <P><B>Silver</B><BR>                  While on the reservation, many Navajo artists created silver         jewelry and textiles for trade. When white traders opened         trading posts on the reservations, a barter system         developed, enabling the Navajo to exchange their handmade         products for tools, canned foods, and other manufactured         products. Silver jewelry was a particularly valuable trade         item, especially by the turn of the century, when railroad         expansion brought a flourishing tourist market to the         Southwest. Commercial jewelry businesses coerced Navajo         artists to mass-produce nontraditional objects such as         boxes, letter openers, and ashtrays. However, silversmiths         who lived outside of large trade centers continued to         produce more traditional art forms, including bracelets,         buckles, and ketohs.</P>                  <P><B>Ketohs</B><BR>                  Ketohs were originally leather straps worn by Navajo archers         to protect their forearms from the snap of the bowstring         when shooting an arrow. By the 1870s, silver was commonly         attached to the leather to give the wearer more protection.         The designs of the silver ketohs gradually became more         intricate as they evolved into the purely decorative form of         jewelry they are today. In the reservation barter system, a         ketoh could be traded for several sheep.</P>                  <P><B>Ketoh</B><BR>                  This ketoh features an open-worked rectangle of silver         attached to a dark brown leather strap. An oval of         <A HREF="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</A> turquoise marks the         center of the piece. Broad curves of silver, like pairs of         leaves around a central bud, extend to the four corners of         the design. Single corn stalks emerge from the top and         bottom of the turquoise.</P>                  <P>Ketoh designs often have an emphatic center like this         one, recalling the sacred place from which the first Navajo         emerged from the giant reed into this world. The symmetrical         four-part organization seen here is also commonly used to         evoke the four cardinal directions. In the Navajo creation         story, Begochiddy brought order out of chaos by dividing the         fourth and final world into four quadrants, marking each         with a mountain. Order and harmony are further evoked in the         ketoh through the careful balance of curved lines,         symbolizing the female ideal of activity, and straight         lines, symbolizing the male ideal of stasis.</P>                  <P><B>H&oacutezh;&oacute;</B><BR>                  The Navajo ideals of order, balance, and harmony are         encompassed in the concept of h&oacutezh;&oacute;, which         roughly means "beauty." To the Navajo, a person is beautiful         if his or her life is in balance. H&oacutezh;&oacute; guides         all aspects of traditional Navajo life, from agriculture to         architecture to medicine. H&oacutezh;&oacute; is represented         in art through balanced, symmetrical, centralized designs         like that of this ketoh.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the Navajo creation story. </B> The design         of traditional Navajo ketohs recalls this creation story.         When the six beings rose into each of the four worlds, they         always emerged at the center.

How do we         experience the presence or absence of order, balance, and         harmony in our lives? How do you feel when you don't get         enough sleep? How do you feel when you don't get enough to         eat? When you eat too much?</P>                  <P><B>4.</B> In Navajo art, curved lines         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOLIST">SYMBOLIZE</A> the female         ideal of activity, and straight lines symbolize the male         ideal of stasis.
