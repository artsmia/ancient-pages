Simply by         speaking the name of something, Re created it. As he named         birds, animals, and things, they appeared. Because Re made         all things, he also controlled them. More powerful than         anyone, he ruled both heaven and earth.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Isis, a clever god gif ted in the arts of magic, envied         Re's power. She desired to know Re's secret Great Name,         because it was the key to his magic and would give her         greater power. Isis spent a lot of time wondering how she         could obtain Re's secret. As Re grew older and weaker, she         devised a plot.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Whenever Re drooled, the wily Isis gathered up his spit.         Kneading the spit with soil, she created a serpent. Although         the serpent came forth from Re, he had not created it, so it         was outside of his control. Isis molded the serpent into the         form of a dart and placed it on Re's daily walking path         across the sky. When Re passed by, the serpent reared up and         stung him.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Soon, Re began to burn with the serpent's venom. He was         baffled by the creature's behavior and dismayed to discover         that he had no power over it. He could not cure his body of         the terrible pain. Re called to his children for help, but         they could not end his suffering.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Then Isis came forth and offered to work her magic to end         Re's pain. However, she insisted she could cure Re only if         he revealed his secret Great Name. Re offered a variety of         nicknames, but clever Isis was not fooled. Fearing for his         life, Re finally gave in and transmitted the Great Name from         his heart to Isis's. That is how Isis successfully learned         the secret of Re's all-powerful magic.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Isis</B><BR>                  According to a rich mythology surrounding the Egyptian         goddess, Isis raised her husband, Osiris (oh-SIGH-rus), from         the dead, protected her son, Horus (HOR-us), from a variety         of certain deaths, and knew the secrets of immortality. She         was faithful, intelligent, strong, and beautiful. Like         Osiris, Isis was associated with vegetation and the cycles         of the seasons and the Nile River. Ancient beliefs         attributed the annual rainfall, which sustained the people         of the Nile Valley, to the tears Isis shed for Osiris.<BR>                  <BR>                  <B>Romans in Egypt</B><BR>                  In the 1st century B.C., Egypt became a province of Rome         under the leadership of Augustus. The Romans ruthlessly         exacted money and resources from Egypt. The Roman rulers         thrived at great expense to the conquered Egyptians. Over         the centuries of Roman domination, people in Egypt and         throughout the Mediterranean world sought hope and comfort         through the worship of the traditional Egyptian gods whose         mythology embraced a central belief in life after         death--Osiris, Isis, and their son, Horus.</P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B>Figures</B><BR>                  In Egypt, people regularly left small bronze figures of         deities at temples or funereal sites in order to attract the         deity represented. By offering a sculpture at a temple, one         could pay homage to a god and hope to gain his or her favor         and protection.</P>                  <P><B>Statuette of Isis</B><BR>                  This statuette of Isis dates to the 1st century A.D., when         Rome ruled over Egypt; the artistic traditions of both         cultures are evident in its design. Traditional         <A HREF="glossary.html#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTES</A> identify         Isis--her crown, serpent,         <A HREF="glossary.html#AMULET">AMULET</A>, and jug. Her         stiff stance is characteristically Egyptian. The sculpture's         naturalism, however, is characteristic of Roman Imperial         art; Isis's large eyes, broad upper lip, and rounded cheeks         all give her face a portrait quality. Much of her gown is         close-fitting, revealing the solidly rounded form of her         breasts, stomach, and thighs. Her gown falls loosely over         her legs in graceful and realistically fluid folds.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>Several aspects of the sculpture are symbolic attributes         of Isis's identity and power. In her left hand Isis holds         her magical dart-shaped serpent, a reference to the power         gained from her knowledge of Re's secret name. In her right         hand is a jug, presumably of sacred water, associated with         accomplished magicians. Over a fabulous wig of cascading         curls, Isis wears the combined crown of Upper and Lower         Egypt, indicating her dominion over both. At the base of her         crown a vulture wraps its wings around her head, symbolizing         her protective powers. At her bust is a Tyt (tit) amulet,         also known as an Isis-knot, a fertility         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</A> and a reference to         her life-giving powers.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> This statuette includes two important features         from the story of Isis.
