A celestial being appeared in         Nebuchadnezzar's dream and ordered him to cut down the tree,         leaving only its roots bound in iron and bronze among the         field grasses. The same being then decreed that the king's         mind be changed from a man's to a beast's.<BR>                  <BR>                  Nebuchadnezzar did not understand his dream, so he called on         the prophet Daniel to interpret it. Daniel said that         Nebuchadnezzar was the strong tree in his dream. He said         that the dream was a decree from God that the mighty king         who ruled without care for anyone but himself would be         driven to dwell with beasts so that he would recognize God's         superior power. Nebuchadnezzar disregarded the dream's         warning and continued to misuse his power. When he failed to         show mercy to those he oppressed, the dream came true.         Driven from human society, Nebuchadnezzar found himself         eating grass as oxen do. He was drenched by the dew of         heaven, and his hair grew into eagles' feathers and his         nails turned into birds' talons.<BR>                           <HR ALIGN="LEFT">         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B></CENTER>Nebchadnezzar</B><BR>                  The story of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and madness is one         ofseveral moralizing, allegorical interpretations of         historical events in the Book of Daniel, written in the 2nd         century B.C. to illustrate the power of God.<BR>                  <BR>                  Nebuchadnezzar II ruled over the Babylonian empire from 605         to 562 B.C. In 586 B.C. he destroyed Jerusalem, and in 573         B.C. he captured Tyre. Shortly thereafter he overran Egypt.         Although there is no historical proof, it is thought that         Nebuchadnezzar may have suffered from a mental illness         called Insania Zoanthropia, which causes humans to act like         animals.<BR>                  <BR>                  <B>William Blake</B><BR>                  The visionary poet and artist William Blake despised the         emphasis on rational thought so popular in 18th-century         England. Sir Isaac Newton's mathematic and scientific         discoveries, which proved the existence of universal laws         and the value of scientific reasoning, heralded the Age of         Enlightenment in Europe. Advancements in areas such as         optics, chemistry, and biology encouraged intellectuals to         put their trust in nature, as understood by reason, rather         than in God. Many people believed that they could rationally         unlock nature's secrets to benefit their own lives.<BR>                  <BR>                  Blake, on the other hand, believed that imagination, not         reason, was the dominant force of human nature. He rebelled         against the art establishment and created his own artistic         vocabulary, often illustrating apocalyptic scenes from the         Bible. His bestial images, including his 1795 version of         <B><I>Nebuchadnezzar</I></B>, illustrated the         uncontrollable, irrational side of human beings. He         apparently intended this image of the mad king to be paired         with an image of Newton that represented rational         thought.<BR>                  <BR>                  <B>Nebuchadnezzar</B><BR>                  In this hand-colored print Blake depicts Nebuchadnezzar as         part animal and part man. The once-mighty Nebuchadnezzar         crawls on his hands and knees, and his feet sport bird's         talons as described in the Book of Daniel. His golden hair,         which was said to grow like an eagle's feathers, trails down         his back and over his thighs. His lengthy beard drags         beneath his taut body. Nebuchadnezzar's parted lips,         furrowed brow, heavy eyelids, and especially his staring         eyes all lend his face an expression of helplessness. The         king's strong muscled body, rendered in great detail, seems         startlingly at odds with his mental instability.<BR>                  <BR>                  Nebuchadnezzar's crawling outdoors, nude, leaves no doubt of         his madness. The large twisted tree trunks and foliage         behind him may refer to the large tree in his dream.<BR>                  <BR>                  The imaginative and emotional tenor of Blake's stunning         picture of Nebuchadnezzar relates it to works by other         artists called         <A HREF="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTICS</A>, who         reacted against the staid         <A HREF="glossary.html#NEOCLASSICISM">NEOCLASSICAL STYLE</A>         with dramatic, often apocalyptic images. But the distinctive         style of this piece, marked by strong contour lines, is         uniquely Blake's.         <HR ALIGN="LEFT">         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look<BR>                  1.</B> Before showing the image, tell the story.
