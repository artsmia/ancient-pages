There, in a temple, lived an Indian priest named Wu         Wei (woo way), who knew how to call forth the dragon who         brings rain. The emperor begged Wu Wei to bring rain to his         scorched land. The priest refused. The heat was seasonable,         he said, and summoning the dragon would do much damage. The         emperor said that the people were suffering because of the         drought. Any rain, he pleaded, even if accompanied by         roaring winds and crashing thunder, would be good. Finally         Wu Wei agreed.</P>                  <P>Wu Wei ordered everything from the temple except for one         bowl of water to be removed. Stirring the water, he repeated         magical words hundreds of times. Presently, a red         finger-sized dragon appeared, raising its head slightly         above the water's surface. Then it slowly disappeared. Wu         wei stirred the water again, chanting a spell three times.         From the bowl a white vapor rose several feet into the air         and floated toward the temple door.</P>                  <P>"Go," Wu Wei ordered the emperor's messenger, "for the         rain is coming!" As he fled to alert the emperor, the         messenger glanced back to see the vapor roll like white silk         out of the temple. Then darkness fell, bringing with it         thunder and rain. Gale winds uprooted giant trees along the         road as the storm overtook the terrified messenger. At last         he reached the emperor, drenched but safe.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Dragons</B><BR>                  The Chinese dragon was a divine bringer of rain, necessary         for the good of all. The dragon was also a symbol of the         good emperor whose wisdom and divine power assured the         well-being of his subjects. Many legends draw connections         between the dragon and the emperor. Some emperors even         claimed to have descended from the dragon. For others,         dragons were special protectors.</P>                  <P>Chinese dragons could make themselves as large as the         universe or as small as a silkworm. They could also change         color and disappear in a flash. Dragons were rarely seen         because they cleverly hid in caves burrowed into the lofty         mountains, or coiled up on the bottom of the deepest seas.         Any sighting of a dragon boded well - it meant that Heaven         was letting the people know that their ruler was doing a         good job. Obviously, rulers were eager to hear of any         reports of dragons in their domain.</P>                  <P><B>Ch'ing Dynasty</B><BR>                  In 1644, the nomadic Manchu (man-CHEW) warriors from         northern China overthrew China's Ming rulers and established         the Ch'ing dynasty. The Manchu admired and quickly adopted         the culture and government of the native Chinese they had         conquered. Still, in their official clothing styles, the         Manchu emphasized their own distinctive cultural heritage.         Inspired by the riding garments of their nomadic days,         Ch'ing robes had long tapered sleeves, tight cuffs, narrow         neck openings, side closures, and slit skirts. Although the         cut was new, Ch'ing robes were decorated with symbols from         traditional Chinese mythology, most notably the dragon.</P>                  <P>Everyone who attended and served at court during the         Ch'ing dynasty wore symbolic robes. Rank and status within         the court were indicated by the cut, color, and symbolic         decoration of one's robe. The highest rank was that of         emperor, empress, or empress dowager. Only they were allowed         to wear yellow robes bearing the five-toed dragon         <A HREF="glossary.html#MOTIF">MOTIF</A> (moe-TEEF).</P>                  <P><B>Dragon Robe</B><BR>                  This type of semiformal court robe is called <I>ch'i-fu</I>         (chee-foo), which translates as "festive dress." The color         and cut indicate that this robe was worn by an empress.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/22a.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="129" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="8"><B>Description</B><BR>                  The dragon on this robe (see detail) is a distinctive type         associated with the emperor. Its wide, flat head is topped         by horns and flanked by wiry whiskers. Scales and sharp         spines cover its curving body. Five short legs with powerful         claws emerge from the dragon's snakelike torso. Flames spark         outward from its joints. The dragon tosses a flaming pearl         between its claws.</P>                  <P>The dragon cavorts in a celestial landscape above a         rainbow-hued diagonal ocean whose frothy waves crash against         three rocky mountains, all of which represent the earth. The         heavens are represented by a band of colorful         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLIZED">STYLIZED</A>, stringy         clouds that curl on top of the waves and float up in little         ovals through the robe.<BR CLEAR="left">                  <BR>                  <B>Symbols</B><BR>                  The dragon is the centerpiece of an elaborate set of images         that symbolize the emperor's authority as an intermediary in         the universal order between heaven and earth. The great and         beneficial power of the dragon could be brought to the         people by the good governance of the emperor. The pearl         within the dragon's grasp is a symbol of wisdom. Like a         worthy emperor, the dragon always seeks wisdom.</P>                  <P>Many symbols of good luck and power surround the dragon.         The whole <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A>         is embroidered with an intricate         <A HREF="glossary.html#PATTERN">PATTERN</A> of connected         bright blue swastikas. In China the swastika symbolized good         luck and the number 10,000. Thus any symbol of blessing laid         against it is multiplied 10,000 times. Several red bats fly         through the heavens below the dragon. Bats were considered         emblems of longevity and happiness because the words for         happiness and bat sound similar. To either side of the         dragon's head are red stylized <I>shou</I> (show)         characters, which wish long life for the robe's wearer.         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Wu Wei and the dragon.         </B>The dragon frequently appears on Chinese court robes         like this one as a <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOL</A>         for the emperor's power to mediate between heaven and earth         for the well-being of the people.

The emperor, empress, and empress dowager         wore yellow robes with five-clawed dragons. The crown prince         wore apricot yellow, while the imperial princes wore blue or         brown. Officials of the first through third ranks dressed in         blue robes with nine dragons.
