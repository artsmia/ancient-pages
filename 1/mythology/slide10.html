Remarkably intelligent and very strong,         Theseus accomplished many amazing tasks. He slayed the         mighty Minotaur (MIN-a-tor) in the Labyrinth of Crete         (CREET), and repulsed an invasion of Athens by the Amazons,         a race of female warriors.</P>                  <P>Pirithous (pi-RITH-oh-us), King of the Lapiths         (LAP-iths), heard of Theseus's reputation and wanted to see         for himself if Theseus was indeed as brave and clever as         people said. So, one day when Theseus was herding his cattle         near Marathon, Pirithous made a raid on his herd. A fight         broke out at once. However, Pirithous overcome with         admiration for Theseus, surrendered and humbly told him that         he would accept any punishment Theseus chose. But Theseus         asked only for his friendship in return.</P>                  <P>Some time later, Pirithous invited his friend Theseus to         his wedding to Hippodamia (hippo-DAME-ee-ah). Among the many         wedding guests were the Centaurs (SEN-tars), neighbors of         Piritho&uuml;s. The Centaurs had the bodies of horses and         the torsos and heads of men. They were an unruly bunch! They         drank too much wine and started to make trouble. When they         tried to kidnap Hippodamia, Theseus quickly intervened,         defeating the Centaurs and saving his friend's bride.</P>                  <P></UL>         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Neoclassicism and Romanticism</B><BR>                  During the 18th century, the excavation of ancient         <A HREF="glossary.html#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A> ruins in the         Roman cities of Herculaneum (her-cue-LANE-ee-um) and Pompeii         (pom-PAY) inspired a revived interest in Greek and Roman art         and ideas. A new art style called neoclassicism developed.         Neoclassicism drew on the art of Greece and Rome and favored         themes drawn from classical myths.         <A HREF="glossary.html#NEOCLASSICISM">NEO-CLASSICAL</A> art         favors idealized forms, attention to detail, and careful         rendering of surface textures. It is calm and restrained.         Male nudes are popular neoclassical subjects, and they         express the ancient Greek concept of the ideal man as one         who, like Theseus, balances physical and intellectual         prowess.</P>                  <P>Neoclassicism is often considered to be an early phase of         the Romantic art movement. Romantic artists frequently         looked to faraway places for their subject matter. But,         unlike neoclassical art, Romantic art tends to be         flamboyantly theatrical and melodramatic.</P>                  <P><B>Antoine-Louis Barye</B><BR>                  The theme of man and beast locked in struggle appealed to         the Romantic French sculptor Antoine Louis (AN-twon LOO-ee)         Barye, who specialized in animal sculpture. Barye regularly         studied and sketched living animals in a zoo as well as         skeletons and preserved specimens in a natural history         museum. He observed dissections and read scholarly papers on         a variety of species. He was especially skilled at sculpting         carnivorous creatures attacking their prey.</P>                  <P><B>Theseus Slaying a Centaur</B><BR>                  The power of Barye's Theseus Slaying a Centaur lies in the         brilliant contrasts of man and beast. Theseus is every bit         the mythological hero, powerful and restrained. His mouth         tightly closed, he calmly looks down at the centaur, who         grimaces in pain. The line of the hero's body flows smoothly         from his raised right arm into the curves of his out-thrust         abdomen and bent knee. In contrast, the centaur's arms,         legs, and tail extend in all directions. As in ancient Greek         statues of athletes, Theseus's tight curls are         idealistically controlled by a head band, while the         centaur's long mane flies wildly.</P>                  <P>The Romantic artists often depicted the turning point in         a tale, as Barye did in this sculpture. Bayre captures the         climactic moment when Theseus is about to lower his club to         destroy the writhing centaur. The hero's grip on his foe's         throat and the centaur's hopeless effort to free himself         create a strong sense of tension. As Theseus digs his large         toe into the centaur's flank, the animal man stumbles and         succumbs. A curving length of cloth falls from the centaur's         back onto the foliage below them and through the beast's         hind legs. The sinuous flow of this cloth adds to the drama         of the scene, while it also subtly counterbalances the         angles created by the centaur's bent knee and right elbow         and the raised elbow of Theseus.</P>                  <P>Barye endowed his figures with the meticulous,         <A HREF="glossary.html#IDEALIZED">IDEALIZED</A> naturalism         and attention to detail found in neoclassical sculpture, as         well as with the high drama and narrative focus of         Romanticism. Through these contrasts, Barye represents not         only a specific moment from the myth of Theseus, but also         the contest of good against evil, the triumph of         civilization over barbarism, and the dominance of         intellectual strength over brute force.</P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> Can you tell who will win this battle, just by         looking at the sculpture? <B>(The human figure:         Theseus.)</B> What visual clues has the artist given you to         predict the outcome? <B>(Theseus is higher than the Centaur.         Theseus's facial expression is calm and determined. The         Centaur appears painful and frantic. Theseus appears to have         command of his body, while the Centaur's limbs and torso         appear twisted and out of control.)</B></P>                  <P><B>2.</B> <B>Tell the story of Theseus.</B> In the story,         Theseus represents good and the Centaur represents the         opposite, evil. How has Barye made these two figures look         opposite in his sculpture? <B>(Theseus's hair is neat and         tidy; the Centaur's hair is wild and messy. Theseus has open         eyes and a closed mouth; the Centaur's eyes are closed and         his mouth is open. Theseus's body appears centered and         compact; the Centaur's limbs and tail fly out into         space.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Where is most of the action taking place in         this sculpture? <B>(In the area between the heads and         shoulders of the two figures.)</B> How has Barye directed         our attention to this area? <B>(Centaur's body is tilted         upward and curves into the area of the action. The figures         interlocking arms curve into each other. Theseus's raised         arm suggests an implied movement toward the Centaur's head.         Theseus gazes directly at the Centaur's head.)</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> Imagine that the limbs and bodies of these two         figures are lines. What kind of lines are they? Are they         thick or thin? Are they smooth? Jagged? Bumpy? Do the lines         curve, spiral, or are they straight? Where do the lines         touch each other? Barye's sculpture implies movement and         tension. How do the quality and direction of the sculpture's         lines contribute to the implied movement and tension?         <B>(Thick, smooth lines sharply curve or angle into one         another, implying movement and tension where the lines         interact. The bodies of the figures can be seen as twisting         or spiraling lines that add to the feeling of tension.)</B>         </P>                  <P><B>5.</B>         <A HREF="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTIC</A> artists         such as Barye paid a great deal of attention to details.         Where can you see Barye's attention to detail in his         sculpture of Theseus and the Centaur? <B>(Musculature of the         two figures; the Centaur's flowing hair, tail, and beard;         the facial expressions of the figures.)</B></P>                  <P>         <HR>         <BR>                  <B>Think </B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Theseus and the Centaur.         </B>What part of the story did Barye choose to represent?         Why do you think he made this choice? Hint: Barye chose to         represent this moment in the story because he was interested         in the French         <A HREF="glossary.html#ROMANTICISM">ROMANTIC</A> values of         his time. The Romantic         <A HREF="glossary.html#STYLE">STYLE</A> in art was highly         theatrical and flamboyant. <B>(Barye chose to represent the         climax of the story, the most active, exciting, and dramatic         moment.)</B> Think of another story you know. What part of         this story would you represent if you were designing a         sculpture in the Romantic style?</P>                  <P><B>2.</B> Sculptures are         <A HREF="glossary.html#THREE-DIMENSIONAL">THREE-DIMENSIONAL</A>.         They take up real space, just like you do. When you look at         Barye's sculpture in the classroom you are seeing a slide of         it - an image projected on a         <A HREF="glossary.html#TWO-DIMENSIONAL">TWO-DIMENSIONAL</A>         screen. How else could you turn Barye's three-dimensional         sculpture into a two-dimensional image? <B>(Take a picture         of it. Make a drawing or painting of it. Flatten it with a         steamroller!)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Barye was a sculptor who specialized in         animals. He studied animals at museums and zoos and liked to         show them in dramatic poses. What other stories can you         think of that Barye might be interested in? <B> (Red Riding         Hood and the Three Little Pigs are confronted by a wolf. The         Hare and the Tortoise. Herakles and the Nemean Lion (see         <I><A HREF="slide7.html">Hydria</A></I> entry). Any stories         that contain animals who perform dramatic feats.)</B></P>                  <P><B>4.</B> Discoveries of ancient ruins during the 18th         century made Greek and Roman art and ideas very popular in         Europe. Can you think of any modern discoveries, inventions,         and technologies that have created a new interest in         something? <B>(New technology created new interest in         "video" pinball games. New media created a resurgence of         interest in neon, Day-Glo colors, and glow-in-the-dark         novelty items. New recycling technology sparked an interest         in recycling and generated recycling products.)</B></P>                  <P>         <HR>            </TD></TR></TABLE> <TABLE BORDER="3">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="introduction.html#top">Introduction</A>         ~ <A HREF="mythbyimage.html#top">Myth by Image</A> ~         <A HREF="culturelist.html#top">Myth by Culture</A> ~         <A HREF="myths.html#top">Mythological Comparisons</A> ~         <A HREF="glossary.html#top">Glossary</A> ~         <A HREF="suggestedreading.html#top">Suggested Readings</A> ~         <A HREF="downloadables.html#top">Downloadable Resources</A>         ~ <A HREF="../tta/classroom_materials_order.html">How to Order</A> ~         <A HREF="myth_evaluation.html#top">Your Comments Wanted</A>         ~ <A HREF="#Story">Story</A> ~         <A HREF="#Background">Background</A> ~         <A HREF="#Questions">Questions</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
