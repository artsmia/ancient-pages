Luana ate people. The people left         behind the old woman Tsenabonpil, fearing that her severely         swollen leg would sink their boat.</P>                  <P>Tsenabonbil gave birth to twin boys, Daror (DAH-roar) and         Damuramurari (dah-moo-rah-moo-RAH-ree). When they were         older, Tsenabonpil told the boys they must kill the evil         pig, Luana. After many adventures they managed to capture         and kill the pig. Tsenabonpil then attached some of the         pig's hair to a coconut and floated it out to the exiled         Lesu people to let them know that Luana was dead.</P>                  <P>When the Lesu people returned in their canoes,         Tsenabonpil assigned them their social structure. She         designated the two marriage classes - the Eagle and the Hawk         - and gave names to the many clans. She gave the Lesu         knowledge of magic, medicine, and crafts. When Tsenabonpil         was done, she and her sons disappeared forever.         <HR>         <A NAME="Background"></A></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>Background</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>New Ireland</B><BR>                  New Ireland is a province of Papua New Guinea (pop-poo-ah         noo GI-nee) and the second largest island in northwest         Melanesia. It forms part of the Bismarck Archipelago.         Tropical rainforests cover much of the island, and a wide         variety of birds, reptiles, and sea animals live there.         Mammals are scarce, except for marsupials, pigs, and dogs.         The importance of the natural world to the people of New         Ireland is evident in their traditional social structure,         mythology, festivals, and art.</P>                  <P><B>Malagan</B><BR>                  One of the central events in the social, economic, and         aesthetic life of New Ireland communities is the malagan, a         festival held in honor of deceased clan members. The         elaborate funeral rites and festivities commemorate         ancestors as well as help the souls of the dead depart the         world of the living and acclimate to the world of the dead.         The malagan festival, which may be held several months, or         even years, after a person's death, brings together large         social groups and provides an opportunity for the moiety and         clan to express solidarity.</P>                  <P>Elaborately carved sculptures are important aspects of         the malagan festival. On the northern coast of New Ireland a         clan member commissions a carver to make special sculptures         to be revealed during festival performances. Depending on         the number ordered, a single commission may take several         months to complete. The ritual process of producing malagan         sculptures is complex and time-consuming; it is as much a         part of the festivities as the performance itself. After the         sculptures are carved and dried, they are placed in an         enclosure built in or near the cemetery. Sea-snail shells         are placed into the eye sockets of the figures. Only then         can the sculptures be painted.</P>                  <P>The dramatic unveiling of the malagan figures at the end         of the festivities is accompanied by generous feasts and         dances at which the spirits of the dead are believed to be         present. The sculptures serve little or no practical         function after a festival and are often left to rot.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="full_jpg/20.jpg" WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="480" X="SAS-UseImageWidth" X="SAS-UseImageHeight" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="8"><B>Malagan Pole</B><BR>                  Standing more than eight feet tall, this malagan pole is         made up of many intricately intertwined animals and humans.         At the top, a man crouches on a frigate bird, and at the         bottom, a woman stands on the head of a wild pig. In the         middle of the pole is a complex         <A HREF="glossary.html#GEOMETRIC">GEOMETRIC</A> design,         called a mataling (MAH-ta-ling), or "eye of fire." At its         center is an eye <A HREF="glossary.html#INLAY">INLAID</A>         with snail shell. A pair of dark, elegantly decorated         frigate birds face the "eye of fire." The lengthy tail         feathers of the upper bird are held by the man and blend         into the feathers of another bird at the very top of the         pole. The lower bird's tail, held by the woman, hangs in         front of the pig at the bottom of the pole.</P>                  <P>White, orange-red, and black pigments are the main colors         of this pole, and traces of a bright yellow pigment are         visible around the central design. When this pole was made,         most pigments were still made from natural materials: white         from lime powder, red from red ocher, black from charcoal         ashes or burned nuts, and yellow from vegetable matter.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/20b.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="90" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="8">The designs on the wild pig's head (see         details) show the northern New Ireland painters' preference         for breaking down large surface areas into small,         decorative, patterned parts. The boar's ears, eyelids, and         long snout are all striped. Around its large white tusks are         many small teeth, indicated by orange-red lines.</P>                  <P><BR>                  <B>Meaning</B><BR>                  The human figures on the malagan probably refer to         ancestors, and the birds to air; together they allude to the         interrelatedness of all things. Because each malagan         commemorates a specific individual in a particular ceremony,         its meaning is known only to those present at that ceremony.         The same image may mean something different to everybody.         For example, to one person the pig at the bottom might stand         for the community's source of food and to another it might         recall the mythic story of the monstrous pig         Luana.<BR CLEAR="left">                           <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Tsenabonpil. </B>The story of         Tsenabonpil came from the people of New Ireland, the same         people who made this <I>malagan</I> pole.

Funeral rites and         festivities help souls depart the world of the living and         acclimate to the world of the dead. How do we honor and         commemorate our ancestors? What kinds of ceremonies do we         have when people in our communities die?</P>                  <P><B>2.</B> Malagan sculptures may take months to carve.         The malagan festival culminates in the unveiling of malagan         sculptures. After the festival is over, the sculptures are         often left to rot. Why do you think the people of New         Ireland leave the sculptures to rot after the malagan         festival? <B>(Once the festival for which they were created         is over, the sculptures are no longer of any use to the         community.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> Malagan sculptures are hidden until the final         day of the malagan ceremony.
