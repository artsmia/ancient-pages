Paintings of this         <A HREF="#STYLE">STYLE</A> celebrate life in small-town,         rural America. The most important regionalist artists,         Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, and Grant Wood, were         all from the Midwest. Their styles, though different, have         traditional, conservative, nationalistic overtones.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="RELIEF"></A><B>RELIEF</B> The projection of a         figure or design from the         <A HREF="#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A> on which it is modeled         or carved.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="RENAISSANCE"></A><B>RENAISSANCE</B> A historical         period spanning the 14th to 16th centuries generally defined         by the revival of arts and letters under the influence of         <A HREF="#CLASSICAL">CLASSICAL</A> models. Because the         Renaissance began in Italy, the term often implies Italian         Renaissance. Early Renaissance refers to the period from         about 1400 to 1500, and High Renaissance refers to the years         between 1500 and 1525. Italian Renaissance art accorded a         new dignity to human beings and their works. This art         reflects interest in humanism, science, and the ideals of         the classical world. Italian artists employed many devices         such as scientific <A HREF="#PERSPECTIVE">PERSPECTIVE</A> to         achieve a sense of <A HREF="#NATURALISTIC">NATURALISM</A> in         their art.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="ROMANTICISM"></A></P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B>ROMANTICISM</B> A reaction to the rationality of         Enlightenment thought and the staid         <A HREF="#NEOCLASSICISM">NEOCLASSICISM</A> of         mid-18th-century art. This artistic concept, which asserted         the validity of subjective experience, entails a love of         exotic or foreign subjects, rich colors, and a dramatic use         of light and line. Romantic artists often explore themes of         passion, imagination, and the subconscious.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="SARCOPHAGUS"></A><B>SARCOPHAGUS</B> A stone         coffin.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="SCALE"></A><B>SCALE</B> The relative size of an         object when compared to others of its kind, to its         environment, or to humans.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><A NAME="SCARIFICATION"></A><B>SCARIFICATION PATTERNS</B>         The decoration of the skin by creating scars that form.

They often         produced expressive, enigmatic images.</P>                  <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>                  <P><B><A NAME="SYMMETRY"></A>SYMMETRY</B> Balance achieved         in a work of art by distributing weight (objects) equally on         both sides of an imaginary center line.
