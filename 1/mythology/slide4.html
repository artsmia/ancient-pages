A series of kings claimed the right         to rule but failed to hold the kingdom together. Rebel         chiefs fought to gain control of the weak kingship. Then a         wise oba restored order to the kingdom, but not without         making enemies.</P>                  <P>Iyase n'Ode, a particularly ambitious town chief and one         of the oba's two military commanders, rebelled against the         oba. The evil chief continued to make trouble in the kingdom         by siding with the jealous rival brother of the next ruler,         Oba Akenzua (ah-ken-ZOO-ah) I.</P>                  <P>Iyase n'Ode was extremely powerful because he had the         ability to turn himself into an elephant. It took the         strength and wisdom of another military commander, the Ezomo         Ehenua, to finally defeat Iyase n'Ode and save the kingdom.         In honor of this victory, Oba Akenzua I made the title of         ezomo, or palace chief, hereditary. Today, Benin ezomos         proudly trace their heritage to the historical hero Ezomo         Ehenua.<BR>                  </P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Benin</B><BR>                  The kingdom of Benin is located in the tropical rainforest         of southern Nigeria. According to the tradition of Benin's         Edo (EE-doe) peoples, it was in the 12th century that the         Edo established their own kingdom. Over the centuries the         geographic boundaries of the kingdom expanded and contracted         according to the political power and wealth of the oba. At         its height in the late 15th and 16th centuries, Benin was a         vast commercial and military power.</P>                  <P>Benin was ruled by kings, called obas, who were absolute         monarchs, considered to be of divine ancestry. Several         groups of chiefs aided the oba in administration of the         kingdom. The highest-ranking palace chief, the ezomo, and         the highest-ranking town chief, the iyase, acted as the         oba's two supreme military commanders. Their military might         and administrative influence gave them tremendous wealth and         power. The palace and town chiefs often struggled for the         oba's favor. In Benin oral history, the iyase is frequently         cast as the oba's opponent.</P>                  <P><B>Ivory</B><BR>                  During the reign of Oba Akenzua I (about 1715 to 1735) ivory         was a highly valued commodity and an important trade item.         The Iyase n'Ode's power base was in the village of Oregbeni         (oar-egg-ben-EE), the locale of the elephant hunter's guild.         That may explain his legendary association in Benin oral         tradition with the elephant. His struggles with the oba may         have been over control of the profitable ivory trade that         began late in the 17th century. <B>Art in Benin</B><BR>                  Most Benin art is made to glorify the oba and to pay homage         to past obas. This art expresses the special power and         privileges of kingship and reinforces the complex hierarchy         of the court.</P>                  <P>One of the most popular forms of Benin art is the carved         ivory tusk. These tusks, which are displayed in sculpted         bronze heads representing Benin's rulers, symbolically         record the stories of Benin's illustrious history. Most         tusks are carved for altars dedicated to the oba. A few,         like this one, are made for the altars of particularly         powerful ezomos in their own courts.</P>                  <P><B>Memorial Tusk</B><BR>                  Rich patterns of human and animal figures carved in low         <A HREF="glossary.html#RELIEF">RELIEF</A> cover the entire         surface of this carved elephant's tusk. Working with small,         sharp tools, the artists chipped, shaved, and carved away         bits of the ivory so that the figures project out from the         <A HREF="glossary.html#BACKGROUND">BACKGROUND</A> core of         the tusk.</P>                  <P>Many of the images on this tusk celebrate the Ezomo         Ehenua's defeat of the Iyase n'Ode and the restoration of         the monarchy. Rather than illustrate every detail of an         event or story, the artist symbolically evokes the story and         its significance. Over generations Benin artists arrived at         <A HREF="glossary.html#ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</A> images that         all viewers could readily recognize and interpret.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/04a.gif" WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=157         ALIGN=left hspace=8></P>                  <P>An ezomo stands at the base of the tusk. (See detail.) In         his right hand he holds a sword to indicate his military         prowess. The diagonal band of rectangles across his chest         and the rings of small rectangles around his neck represent         the coral-beaded <A HREF="glossary.html#REGALIA">REGALIA</A>         worn at the oba's court. A typical figure type in Benin art,         he is short with small legs and an oversized head. On each         side of the ezomo is a barely visible (because of abrasion)         abstract image of an elephant's trunk that turns into a hand         holding leaves. These symbolize extraordinary physical         strength and knowledge.<BR>                  <BR>                  Above the ezomo stands the oba. He wears similar regalia and         grabs an elephant trunk in each of his hands to symbolize         his strength. Above his head is a leopard, another symbol of         his power, since both the oba and the leopard were admired         for their strength, agility, fierceness, and cunning.</P>                  <P><IMG SRC="Thumbnails/04b.gif" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=158         ALIGN=right hspace=8></P>                  <P>Abstract representations of elephants appear throughout         this tusk. (See detail.) In this large frontal image three         bent lines indicate the elephant's forehead, from which         spring its floppy ears. A few curved lines make its eyes,         and many straight lines emanate from a long curving central         line to create its powerful trunk. Elephant images such as         this one are still identified today as the Iyase n'Ode, the         oba's magical and dangerous opponent. By recalling Ezomo         Ehuena's victory over the terrible elephant-chief, the tusk         asserts and reinforces the power of the present ezomo as         well. It also reminds viewers that the right to inherit the         position of ezomo was granted by the grateful         oba.<BR clear=right>                  </P>                  <P>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Questions"></A><B>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of Ezomo Ehenua. </B>Does the         tusk tell the whole story of Ezomo Ehenua?
