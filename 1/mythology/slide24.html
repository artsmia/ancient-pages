He         was considered very ugly. Hoping to advance his career, he         took the examinations required to enter government service.         Although he performed brilliantly, Shoki's dreams of         advancement were shattered. Some say Shoki was cruelly         cheated out of first place. Others say he was awarded first         place by the examiners, who praised his work, saying it was         equal to that of the wisest ancients. But when Shoki was         presented to the court, the emperor rejected him because he         was so ugly.</P>                  <P>In shame, Shoki took his own life on the steps of the         imperial palace, right in front of the emperor. Overcome         with remorse, the emperor ordered that Shoki be buried with         the highest honors, wrapped in a green robe usually reserved         for members of the imperial clan. In gratitude, Shoki's         spirit vowed to protect any ruler against the evil of         demons.</P>                  <P></UL>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><A NAME="Background"></A><B>Background</B>         </CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Japan and China</B><BR>                  When the Japanese imported Buddhism from China in the 6th         century, they also assumed many other aspects of Chinese         culture, including their mythology. The popular story of         Shoki was adopted from China, where he was known as Chung         Kuei (chung guay). During the Edo (ED-oh) period in Japan         (1600-1868), families began to hang banners depicting Shoki         inside and outside of their houses during the Boys' Day         festival. Boys' Day is celebrated on the fifth day of the         fifth month of the lunar year. According to ancient         tradition, this is a day when evil spirits and bad luck         abounds. Images of Shoki ward off danger from the homes of         families with male children.</P>                  <P><B>Rising Merchant Class</B><BR>                  During Japan's Edo period, great cities and a new,         prosperous merchant class flourished. Middle-class tastes         were significantly different from those of the Buddhist         priests and shogunate (the government under a shogun) that         had dominated artistic patronage in the past. Members of the         new middle class preferred scenes of everyday life and         illustrations of folk stories like Shoki the Demon Queller.         By the 18th century many artists depicted Shoki in prints         for this new audience.</P>                  <P><B>Prints</B><BR>                  As a result of this new patronage and the development of a         many-colored woodblock printing process, an abundance of         printed materials were made available to all. Novels,         pictures, and poetry helped inform the Japanese of their own         cultural heritage as well as artistic styles and themes         imported from China. For commoners who could not afford a         painting, these new prints offered an affordable         alternative.</P>                  <P>The long narrow format of         <A HREF="glossary.html#PILLAR">PILLAR PRINTS</A>, achieved         by pasting together two sheets of paper, was popular and         practical. Whereas most prints were pasted into albums,         pillar prints were hung in the home. The traditional         Japanese house had very few walls, and the sliding doors         that divided the rooms were made of paper. Structural wooden         pillars were the only place where pictures could be hung.         </P>                  <P><B>Masanobu</B><BR>                  The artist Masanobu (maa-saw-no-boo) (1686-1764) invented         the popular pillar print format. He was one of Japan's most         important painters and printmakers during the 18th century.         By his own account, Masanobu was responsible for dozens of         technical and stylistic innovations in printmaking.</P>                  <P><B>Shoki, the Demon Queller</B><BR>                  Shoki typically appears as a portly bewhiskered man. He         wears scholar's robes, a hat, and heavy knee-high boots and         carries a large sword. His large eyes, bulbous nose, and         fierce expression are also characteristic features. In this         print Shoki rounds a corner in hot pursuit of a demon. His         eyes bulge out as he spies his prey. His left hand tenses,         while his right reaches for his long broad sword.</P>                  <P>Masanobu deftly varies his use of line to convey mood,         texture, and mass. The thick, wavy, jagged outlines of         Shoki's drapery capture his intense vitality. The fine         delicate lines of his wild windblown beard and hair contrast         the thicker lines of his bushy eyebrows and mustache.         Masanobu uses dramatic shading in light and dark to         emphasize the bulk of the figure.</P>                  <P>Masanobu creatively uses this narrow vertical format to         enhance his storytelling. Shoki does not fill the length of         the print, but is relegated instead to the lower two-thirds.         This position emphasizes his short and portly stature. By         cropping from view much of Shoki's arms, one leg, and the         ends of his hair and beard, Masanobu gives the impression of         catching a quick glimpse of the elusive demon queller.</P>                  <P>The characters (the         <A HREF="glossary.html#SYMBOL">SYMBOLS</A> used in the         Japanese writing system) placed in the lower left corner of         this pillar print of Shoki, are the artist Masanobu's studio         name, Hogetsudo (hoe-get-sue-doe), and his signature,         Okumura Bunkaku Masanobu (oh-ku-mer-ah boon-ka-ku         maa-saw-no-boo).</UL>         <HR>         </P>                  <P><CENTER><B><A NAME="Questions"></A>Discussion         Questions</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><B>Look</B><BR>                  <B>1.</B> <B>Tell the story of <I>Shoki, the Demon         Queller</I>. </B>What is Shoki doing in this picture?         <B>(Running!)</B> Can you find his sword? <B>(Hangs down to         the left of his boot.)</B> <B>Explain the format of         <A HREF="glossary.html#PILLAR">PILLAR PRINTS</A>, made to         hang on narrow pillars in a traditional Japanese home. </B>         Why would Okumura Masanobu         <A HREF="glossary.html#CROP">CROP</A> off part of Shoki's         body when he made this print? <B>(To give the impression of         a fleeting glimpse of Shoki on the move.)

Shoki's spirit was grateful for the         emperor's remorse and belated respect. Do you think Shoki         should have been grateful? Why or why not?

Was it         easy to forgive?</P>                  <P><B>2.</B> During the Edo period in Japan, families hung         pictures of Shoki inside and outside their houses to protect         their male children during the Boys' Day festival. Why do         you suppose Shoki came to be considered protection for boys?         <B>(Perhaps because Shoki's real life role of scholar and         his afterlife role as protectorate were male-dominated roles         in Japan, roles considered inappropriate for girls or         women.)</B></P>                  <P><B>3.</B> During the Edo period,         <A HREF="glossary.html#PRINT">PRINTS</A> like this one were         popular among the Japanese middle class because they were an         affordable alternative to original paintings.
