Their performances capture         the distinctive spirit and energy of these dances, which revolutionized         the idiom of dance in the early part of this century.       <p>The company has performed in numerous concerts at the West Side Dance         Project in New York City, as well as at the Children's Museum of Manhattan,         the Baltimore Museum of Art and in a series of concerts at the Greek Cultural         Center in Queens, New York.       <p> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greek Myths For Children         </font></b>      <p>Modern dance pioneer Isadora Duncan created many dances based on the         Greek myths and performed them to the music of Chopin, Gluck and other         great composers. Using these dances, Maria Boscaino, Artistic Director         of The American Heritage Dance Company, has created programs that combine         the performance of these works with narration. On Sunday, January 24,         1999 the company will perform "Artemis &amp; Company" at the <a href="family_days.html">Mervyn's         California "As Good as Gold Family Day". </a>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Artemis &amp; Company </b></font>      <p>The Goddess Artemis played an important role in the stories of many myths.         This program illustrates her multidimensional personality. Included are         dances that portray her anger at Agamemnon and her subsequent mercy shown         to his daughter, Iphigenia; her favoritism of Echo, who fell in love with         Narcissus; and the idolization of heroic Artemis by the Amazons and her         own Woodland Nymphs. The program ends with a rousing dance of Artemis         with her huntresses performed to the last movement of Schubert's 9th Symphony.       <p align="center"><img src="GIF/heratige_dancers.jpg" width="304" height="193">    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
