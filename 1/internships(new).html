All candidates with skills, interests, or         experiences relevant to museum work are eligible.</P>                  <P>Internships may range from one to twelve months in         length, with a minimum time commitment of twenty hours per         week expected. Intern positions are typically         project-oriented within a specific department. A frequent         classroom component acquaints interns with various         functions, programs, departments, and staff of the museum         and/or relate to the intern experience. Students often         arrange academic credit for their experience through their         college or university.</P>                  <P>The availability of internships is determined by the         needs of individual departments throughout the year, within         the limitations of staff and space availability, exhibition         schedules and the varying potential for challenging intern         projects. Candidates may consider internships in several         areas of the museum, including the Curatorial, Education,         Marketing and Communications, and Development Divisions.         </P>                  <P>Interns are placed three times each year.
