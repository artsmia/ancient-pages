You            throw it over your head and you grab something. . . .            It's like writing. You can read a line in a painting            almost the way you can read a word."<BR>                        <BR>                        Examine the use of line in this painting. Where has the            artist used line to outline? <B>(glass and wine            bottle)</B>. Where do you find straight lines?            <B>(toothpaste tube)</B>. Where do you find a series of            lines? <B>(piano keys)</B>.

Where do you see two complementary colors            together? What size and shape are they? Which is bigger?            Which is brighter?
