Maybe you noticed an interesting shape as you            passed a store window, the color of a poster at the bus            stop, or the patterns made by the lines in the road.            Every minute of every day--as we ride to work, watch            television, or read a magazine--thousands of images            surround us. These images from everyday life are the            subject of Grace Hartigan's painting <U>Billboard</U>.            Drawing on her experiences in New York in the 1950s,            Hartigan incorporated familiar elements of urban America            into her work. In this painting, the fragments of figures            and forms recall billboard images seen fleetingly from            the highway.                        <DT>&nbsp;                        <DD>In <U>Billboard</U> Hartigan structured seemingly            chaotic images into a unified and ordered composition.            She believes that "the rawness must be resolved into form            and unity; without the 'rage for order' how can there be            art?" Using vivid colors and bold, dynamic brushstrokes,            she infused the forms with energy and life, arranging            them by size and            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1492803">intensity</A> of            color to            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1497874">balance</A> the            composition. No part of this painting seems to hold our            attention longer than another; our eye wanders from one            bright color and interesting shape to the next. Hartigan            achieved this effect mainly through the careful use of            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1499012">complementary            colors</A>--red and green, blue and orange, yellow and            purple. She believes that "you should be able to enter a            painting like a promenade--that you should be able to            walk in anywhere and walk out anywhere."         </DL>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
