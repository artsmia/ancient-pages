Maybe you noticed an interesting shape         as you passed a store window, the color of a poster at the         bus stop, or the patterns made by the lines in the road.         Every minute of every day-as we ride to work, watch         television, or read a magazine-thousands of images surround         us. These images from everyday life are the subject of Grace         Hartigan's painting <U>Billboard</U> Drawing on her         experiences in New York in the 1950s, Hartigan incorporated         familiar elements of urban America into her work. In this         painting, the fragments of figures and forms recall         billboard images seen fleetingly from the highway.<BR>                  <BR>                  In <U>Billboard</U> Hartigan structured seemingly chaotic         images into a unified and ordered composition. She believes         that "the rawness must be resolved into form and unity;         without the 'rage for order' how can there be art?" Using         vivid colors and bold, dynamic brushstrokes, she infused the         forms with energy and life, arranging them by size and         <B>intensity</B> of color to <B>balance</B> the composition.         No part of this painting seems to hold our attention longer         than another; our eye wanders from one bright color and         interesting shape to the next. Hartigan achieved this effect         mainly through the careful use of <B>complementary         colors</B>--red and green, blue and orange, yellow and         purple. She believes that "you should be able to enter a         painting like a promenade--that you should be able to walk         in anywhere and walk out anywhere."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Abstract Expressionism</FONT></B></P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>After World War II, America emerged as a         great world leader and New York replaced Paris as the art         center of the Western world. A group of New York artists         called Abstract Expressionists captured the speed, energy,         and power of American life with a new way of painting. Their         spontaneous, gestural style, known as <B>action         painting</B>, often revealed the raw physical vigor of the         creative process. The application of the paint became their         subject, as they slashed, spattered, spilled, and splashed         it onto their canvases.<BR>                  <BR>                  Soon younger artists flocked to New York to become part of         the <B>New York School</B>. They adopted the energetic,         gestural style of the older Abstract Expressionists but         turned from purely abstract art to recognizable         subjects--landscapes, still lifes, and figures. Grace         Hartigan belongs to this "second generation" of Abstract         Expressionists.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Style and Technique</FONT></B></P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Hartigan employs both abstraction and         <B>figuration</B>, refusing to see them as mutually         exclusive. Inspired by subjects encountered in daily life,         she combines abstract and <B>representational</B> forms to         create paintings of great visual and emotional power. She         describes her subjects as real, but not realistic.<BR>                  <BR>                  Hartigan drew repeatedly on the accessible imagery and         boldly simplified style of American advertising. In         <U>Billboard</U> we glimpse a smiling face above a tube of         Ipana toothpaste, the neck of a wine bottle poised over a         glass, molded lime Jell-O surrounded by fruit, and the keys         of a piano. She began the painting by cutting images from         Life magazine and pinning them up on the wall in the form of         a <B>collage</B>; then she painted the remaining background         purple. This collage of commercial, mechanical, and urban         imagery became the model for her painting. "I have found my         'subject,'" she said, "it concerns that which is vulgar and         vital in American modern life, and the possibilities of its         transcendence into the beautiful."<BR>                  <BR>                  The fragmentary images in <U>Billboard</U> are arranged into         an ordered composition unified by Hartigan's bold,         expressive brushwork and balanced by her placement of the         colors on the canvas. For instance, the large rectangle of         purple on the right is balanced by a smaller square of         yellow (purple's complement) on the left. The red of the         circular apple is intensified by the surrounding green         (red's complement). The same green is repeated in the lower         right corner, where it takes on a different appearance next         to the<B> analogous colors</B> of blue and darker green.         </P></BLOCKQUOTE>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The Artist</FONT></B></P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Grace Hartigan was born in Newark, New         Jersey, in 1922. After high school she moved to Los Angeles,         where she took her first drawing class. In 1942 she returned         to New Jersey and studied mechanical drafting. It was         wartime, and she worked in an airplane factory, painting         watercolor still lifes in her spare time.<BR>                  <BR>                  In 1945 Hartigan moved to New York to be in the center of         the art world. She was one of the first young artists to         admire <B>Abstract Expressionism </B>at a time when few took         contemporary American art seriously. Greatly influenced by         the Abstract Expressionists, she quickly absorbed their         spontaneous, abstract style, but she also became interested         in the works of the European old masters, such as Raphael,         Rubens, and Caravaggio.<BR>                  <BR>                  In 1959 the Museum of Modern Art in New York sent an         exhibition called "The New American Painting" to eight         European countries. Only one woman was included in this         famous exhibition--Grace Hartigan.
