After high school she moved to Los Angeles, where            she took her first drawing class. In 1942 she returned to            New Jersey and studied mechanical drafting. It was            wartime, and she worked in an airplane factory, painting            watercolor still lifes in her spare time.<BR>                        <BR>                                                <DD>In 1945 Hartigan moved to New York to be in the            center of the art world. She was one of the first young            artists to admire            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1544542">Abstract            Expressionism</A> at a time when few took contemporary            American art seriously. Greatly influenced by the            Abstract Expressionists, she quickly absorbed their            spontaneous, abstract style, but she also became            interested in the works of the European old masters, such            as Raphael, Rubens, and Caravaggio.<BR>                        <BR>                                                <DD>In 1959 the Museum of Modern Art in New York sent an            exhibition called "The New American Painting" to eight            European countries. Only one woman was included in this            famous exhibition--Grace Hartigan. In the 1960s Hartigan            moved to Baltimore, where she still lives and paints.         </DL>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
