Inspired by         subjects encountered in daily life, she combines abstract         and         <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1531728">representational</A>         forms to create paintings of great visual and emotional         power. She describes her subjects as real, but not         realistic.</P>                  <P>Hartigan drew repeatedly on the accessible imagery and         boldly simplified style of American advertising. In         <U>Billboard</U> we glimpse a smiling face above a tube of         Ipana toothpaste, the neck of a wine bottle poised over a         glass, molded lime Jell-O surrounded by fruit, and the keys         of a piano. She began the painting by cutting images from         <U>Life</U> magazine and pinning them up on the wall in the         form of a <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1533809">collage</A>;         then she painted the remaining background purple. This         collage of commercial, mechanical, and urban imagery became         the model for her painting. "I have found my 'subject,'" she         said, "it concerns that which is vulgar and vital in         American modern life, and the possibilities of its         transcendence into the beautiful."</P>                  <P>The fragmentary images in <U>Billboard</U> are arranged         into an ordered composition unified by Hartigan's bold,         expressive brushwork and balanced by her placement of the         colors on the canvas. For instance, the large rectangle of         purple on the right is balanced by a smaller square of         yellow (purple's complement) on the left. The red of the         circular apple is intensified by the surrounding green         (red's complement). The same green is repeated in the lower         right corner, where it takes on a different appearance next         to the <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1538177">analogous         colors</A> of blue and darker green.</BLOCKQUOTE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
