You            throw it over your head and you grab something. . . .            It's like writing. You can read a line in a painting            almost the way you can read a word."<BR>                        <BR>                        Examine the use of line in this painting. Where has the            artist used line to outline? Where do you find straight            lines? Where do you find a series of lines? Where do you            see lines that are curved? squiggly? jagged? thin?            thick?<BR>                        <BR>                        Discuss how different lines evoke different            responses.<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Choose a color. Where is the largest shape of that            color? the smallest? What colors surround it? Does the            color appear to change? If it appears to change, discuss            why.<BR>                        <BR>                        Discuss the use of            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1499012">complementary            colors</A>. Where do you see two complementary colors            together? What size and shape are they? Which is bigger?            Which is brighter? Is the color composed of one large            shape or many smaller shapes?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Hartigan began <U>Billboard</U> by making a            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1533809">collage</A> of            flat,            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1577941">overlapping</A>            images taken from <U>Life</U> magazine.

Does the            painting appear flat, or does it appear to have depth?            Are there colors that appear to recede or advance?            Discuss the use of            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1580028">cool colors</A> and            <A HREF="glossary.html#anchor1581255">warm colors</A>.            How do the colors affect the impression of depth?         </OL>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
