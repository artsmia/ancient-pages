What sounds do            you hear? Where are they coming from? Are they loud?            soft? harmonious? Do you hear a single sound? many sounds            at once?

Why?<BR>                        <BR>                        Now pretend that you can only walk on the blue sections.            Which parts of the painting could you travel to?

Did you ever want to buy something because of an            advertisement? What was so persuasive about the ad? Where            did you see the ad? Who were you with? What were you            doing? How do all those factors affect how we see?<BR>                        <BR>                        There are many different types of images we are exposed            to every day through newspapers, magazines, signs,            television, computers, etc. How would life be different            without those images? Did a billboard or sign ever make            you laugh, or make you angry? What was the image or            message that made you respond that way?<BR>                        <BR>                                                <LI>Grace Hartigan said: "I do not wish to describe my            subject matter, or reflect upon it--I want to distill it            until I have its essence."<BR>                        <BR>                        Discuss the meaning of the word <U>essence</U>. What            qualities cause a thing to be itself? Discuss the essence            of a chair. What makes it a chair? What can you take away            from it without taking away its essence? How has Grace            Hartigan conveyed the essence of New York City in her            painting <U>Billboard</U>?         </OL>      </TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
