You will receive written confirmation of your         reservation three weeks before your tour date, and your         docent will call you about one week prior to your tour to         discuss your group's needs.</P>                  <P>Please divide your students into groups of 15 before you         arrive. One adult chaperone is required for every 15         students during the tour. Chaperones should not bring         preschool children.</P>                  <P><BR>                  <A NAME="group"></A><B>Group Tours</B><BR>                  Volunteer docents lead tours for 15 or more. Tours encourage         students to discuss their own opinions and observations         about art from around the world. A question as simple as         What's going on in this picture? can elicit surprisingly         different responses. Questions like Why do you think the         artist chose to paint the sky yellow? or How would the         sculpture look if it were clay instead of wood? invite         students to think analytically and to share their responses         with others.</P>                  <P>Most tours last about one hour. Tours fill quickly, so         call early. Best bets are fall and winter. (Many of our         spring tours are completely booked by late fall.) All tours         are free, except writing tours and workshops.</P>                  <P>Please call:</P>                  <UL>            <LI>870-3140 To schedule a tour                        <LI>870-3134 To reserve a related video or slide set                        <LI>870-3205 or 870-3206 To plan a writing activity,            arrange a tour series, or plan a unique field trip         </UL>                  <P><BR>                  <B>New Student Lunch Area<BR>                  </B>We now have a new space where students can eat lunches         they bring.
