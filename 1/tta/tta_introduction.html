These are just a few of the adventures         you may have by using our extensive educational resources.         </P>                  <P>This catalog describes the museum's resources and         customized services that introduce students to the diverse         world of art. Our classroom materials and guided tours are         broadly based in the humanities and relevant to every area         of study-from social studies and language arts to math and         science. We hope you'll make our resources and collection         integral parts of your curriculum.</P>                  <P>Be sure to visit our new gallery spaces, too. We continue         to reinstall the collection in more meaningful ways and have         placed many works on view for the first time. Look for new         Indian, Himalayan, and Southeast Asian galleries this fall         and for new, more comprehensive African galleries next         spring! Of course, as we reinstall galleries, some works of         art may be temporarily in storage. This year, the Chinese         and Japanese collections will be off view until August 1998.         We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this expansion         and reinstallation may cause. To find out if a particular         work or tour will be available when you come, call the Tour         Scheduling Office at (612) 870-3140. We look forward to         serving you!</P>                  <P>The Education Division</P>                  <P>The Minneapolis Institute of Arts<BR>                           <HR>         <B>To help integrate the visual arts into your curriculum,         please call:</B></P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Curriculum Materials: (612)         870-3134<BR>                  Tours: Sandy Satz or Valerie Kriesel (612) 870-3140<BR>                  Custom-designed tours: Dieane Levy (612) 870-3205<BR>                  or Sheila McGuire (612) 870-3206</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>      </TD></TR></TABLE><HR><A HREF="../index.html" TARGET="_top">Main Menu</A> ~<A HREF="../education.html#top" TARGET="right">EducationalPrograms</A> ~ <A HREF="../curriculum_materials.html#top"TARGET="right">Curriculum Materials</A> ~<A HREF="tta_menu.html#top">Teaching the Arts Catalog</A> ~<A HREF="tta_tours.html#top">Teaching the Arts Tours</A> ~<A HREF="art_adventure_program.html#top">Art Adventure Program</A> ~<A HREF="classroom_materials.html#top">Classroom Materials</A> ~<A HREF="tta_materials_for_sale.html#top">Materials for Sale</A><HR></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
