And I guess that's what we try         to do by reading clues off textiles."</i> <br>        <br>        <img src="main.jpg"  align=right>Minneapolis Institute of Arts textile         department curator, Lotus Stack, has been studying clues from textiles         all of her life. And she's been practicing these skills at the museum         for twenty years. What she brings to the collection and, ultimately, the         museum audience, is an intense fascination, not only with the objects         themselves, but also with the history and people behind them. As suggested         in the quote above, Stack virtually inhabits these objects, gaining a         kind of insight and knowledge normally reserved for the original makers,         owners, and wearers--be they Peruvian villagers or European kings and         queens.<br>        <br>        Recently, Stack brought that insight to the museum's Interactive Media         Group for a collaborative project--an exciting new computer presentation         focusing on textiles, now on permanent view near the museum's third floor         rotunda.<br>        <br>        With the unveiling of this program, you might say that things have come         full circle. Consider that the Jacquard loom, an early 19th-century invention         that takes advantage of punch-cards and intricate machinery for the production         of patterned cloth, is the antecedent to the computer. Now, at the close         of the technology-frenzied 20th century, the Institute has produced an         interactive touch-screen program that weaves the stories and teaches the         essentials of textile history and technique. <br>        <br>        <i>Material Witnesses: Textiles at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts</i>         is the eighth in the museum's award-winning series of permanent collection-based         multimedia programs designed and installed for gallery visitors. It exploits         the sophistication inherited from its fabric-producing predecessors in         telling tales of textile use, value, and production, and demonstrating         technical fundamentals. <br>        <br>        The project concentrates on seven primary objects, chosen for the cultural,         historic, geographic, and technical diversity they represent. It approaches         these objects as though they were <i>evidence</i>--materials conveying         clues that help piece together stories of daily life in a wide array of         times, places, and circumstances. The objects range from a 16th-century         Turkish velvet woven for a sultan's court, to a 20th-century American         creation--a prime example from the innovative Fiber Art movement. <br>        <br>        <img src="kaffe.jpg"  align=left>In an effort to involve the user, a simulated         magnifying glass allows examination of the pieces in close detail. In         addition, each object is supported by a five- to ten-minute presentation         that answers questions about who made it, under what conditions and for         what purposes. Seven textile experts, ranging from artist Kaffe Fassett         to conservator Nobuko Kajitani, each provide succinct commentary on one         of the primary objects.<br>        <br>        Also, an additional 175 related objects from the Institute's rich and         still-growing collection (witness the recent addition of the Larsen archive)         are presented and discussed. Finally, five technical areas invite the         museum visitor to create onscreen his or her own quilt, weaving, dyed         fabric, and more. The entire program has been designed to allow its users         to participate in the act of discovering textiles--and broader cultural         history--by examining, questioning and doing. <img src="quilt.jpg"  align=right><br>        <br>        While <i>Material Witnesses</i> may rely on metaphor to get its points         across, there is a degree to which textiles--and all works of art--are         literal recordings of human experience. And a keen eye coupled with an         eagerness to know human beings--present and past--can yield some profound         and inspired insights. As the curator happily concludes, "...in a way         the threads have recorded these memories for me and do lead me into the         lifestyles and the time of these people, and the excitement and joys that         they had." It is hoped that <i>Material Witnesses</i> will do the same,         bringing possibilities for intense excitement and learning to museum visitors.<br>        <br>        <i>Material Witnesses: Textiles at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts</i>         is currently on view in the interactive learning station off the third         floor east hall gallery (310). It was produced with funds generously donated         by the General Mills Foundation. </p>      <p><a href="../img.html"><img src="../GIF/img.gif" width="164" height="27" border="0"></a></p>    </td>  </tr></table><H2>&nbsp; </H2></BODY></HTML>
