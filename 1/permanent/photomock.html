More than 7,500         items strong, the collection consists primarily of 20th-century American         work, but increasing emphasis on photographs from all countries is providing         new scope and dimension to our already rich and diverse holdings.<br>        <br>        The Department of Photography has developed and continues to thrive because         of the active and generous support of loyal donors. Notably, the very         earliest acquisitions were funded by Kate Butler and Hall James Peterson.         Their initiative inspired others, including Harry Drake, Martin Weinstein,         and Fred and Ellen Wells. The Petersons continued gifts for nearly six         years formed the core of the collection. More recently, the creation of         the Alfred and Ingrid Lenz Harrison Fund, along with the establishment         of the Harrison Photography Galleries, has given the department enormous         momentum. These superb new galleries are devoted to the presentation of         our permanent collection. <br>        <br>        Over the years, the Department of Photography has been committed to using         the collection for educational purposes, and the Institute now serves         as a major resource for the five-state area. Numerous exhibitions drawn         from the collection have also traveled to smaller institutions, and high         school and college students frequently visit our galleries and print study         area. </p>      </td>    <td width="50%" valign="top" height="471">       <div align="left"><b>Highlighted Work</b><br>      </div>      <hr align="center">      <a href="../maep.html"><font color="#660000"><b> </b></font></a>      <table " border="0" cellspacing="5">        <tr>           <td width="116"><img src="images/mia_12156h.jpg" width="110" height="120"></td>          <td width="126" valign="top"> <br>            <font size="-1"><b>Berenice Abbott</b><br>            New York<br>            20th century<br>            gelatin silver print <br>            H.8-5/8 x W.7-15/16 in.<br>            The Ethel Morrison Van Derlip Fund<br>            <br>            <a href="ff">More&gt;&gt; </a></font></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><b>Browse<br>        </b><a href="http://www.artsmia.org/uia-bin/uia_list.cgi/mia_collection.ldb/key/photo/noframes/page_len/10">Selected         Works from the Photography Collection</a><b> </b></p>      <hr align="center">      <p><b> Electronic Postcards</b><br>        <a href="http://www.artsmia.org/uia-bin/uia_list.cgi/artsmia_cards.ldb/key/photo/noframes/page_len/10">Send         a postcard from our Photography Collection</a></p>      <hr align="center">      <p><b>Collection Related Online Program</b>s:<br>        &#149; <a href="sf"><b>Get the Picture</b>: Thinking about Photographs<br>        </a>&#149; <b><a href="http://www.artsmia.org/playground/muy">Animal Locomotion</a></b><a href="http://www.artsmia.org/playground/muy">:         Edweard Muybridge</a><b><br>        </b> </p>      <hr align="center">      <form action="/permanent/search.cfm" method="post" target="_top">        <b>Search the Museums Collection</b><br>        Over 2,000 works from our collection are available online.
