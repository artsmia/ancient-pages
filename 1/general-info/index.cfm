The museum         building, designed by the firm of McKim, Mead and White, opened its doors         in 1915. In 1974 the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange was commissioned to         design needed additions to the neoclassical structure. In the 1990s, with         funds from the New Beginnings Campaign, the museum was renovated, the         collections reinstalled, and state of the art technology introduced to         help visitors and members interpret the works of art.</p>      <p><img src="images/a-new-audience.gif" width="302" height="20" vspace="10" hspace="10">         <br>        With a grant from The Pew Charitable Trusts, The Minneapolis Institute         of Arts has recently completed a major campaign to identify underserved         audiences and make the museum part of their lives.

Support for programs         is also provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
